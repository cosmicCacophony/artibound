## What Is an Archetype?

**An archetype = Color combination + Strategy + Win condition**

**Examples:**
- **RW Legion**: Red/White + Go-wide tokens + Overwhelm with buffs
- **UB Control**: Blue/Black + Removal-heavy + Outvalue opponent
- **GU Ramp**: Green/Blue + Ramp + Big finishers

**In PVE, all archetypes should be viable** - No "tier system." Each archetype should have a path to beat bosses.

## Archetype Cross-Pollination

### Which Archetypes Share Cards?

**Aggro (RW) Shares With:**
- Minimal sharing - very archetype-specific
- Legion tribal cards RW-only
- Maybe shares combat tricks with other red decks

**Control (UB, UBG) Shares With:**
- Removal spells work in all control decks
- AOE spells work in all control decks
- Card draw works in all decks

**Midrange (Black-based) Shares With:**
- Black removal works in all black decks
- Efficient creatures work in many decks
- Most flexible archetype

**Ramp (GU, GU+splash) Shares With:**
- Ramp units work in all green decks
- Big finishers work in any slow deck
- Flexible archetype

### Which Are Incompatible?

**RW Legion ↔ UB Control:**
- Legion tribal doesn't work in control
- Spell boosters don't work in aggro
- Completely different game plans

**Aggro ↔ Ramp:**
- Ramp too slow for aggro
- Aggro units too small for ramp
- Different curves

**2-Color ↔ 5-Color:**
- 5-color needs artifacts, 2-color doesn't
- Can't pivot between these
- Must commit early
