# RGW Big Dumb Creatures Archetype

## Overview

A straightforward midrange archetype focused on deploying large creatures and finishing with powerful buff spells that consume runes. This archetype has a **higher floor** (easier to build, more consistent) but a **lower ceiling** (less powerful than complex multicolor control decks).

## Core Strategy

1. **Deploy Big Creatures**: Play 5-8 mana creatures with solid stats
2. **Support with Buffs**: Use rune-consuming buff spells to finish games
3. **Go Wide**: Leverage team-wide buffs to overwhelm opponents

## Archetype Characteristics

### Strengths
- **High Floor**: Easy to draft - just take big creatures and buff spells
- **Consistent**: Less dependent on specific synergies or combos
- **Straightforward**: Clear game plan that's easy to execute
- **Resilient**: Big creatures are hard to remove, buffs make them even bigger

### Weaknesses
- **Lower Ceiling**: Less powerful than optimized multicolor control decks
- **Vulnerable to Removal**: If opponent has enough removal, big creatures can be inefficient
- **Mana Intensive**: Requires hitting land drops and having enough mana for both creatures and buffs
- **Predictable**: Opponent knows your game plan

## Color Identity

**Red/White/Green (RWG)**
- **Red**: Aggressive creatures, combat tricks, damage
- **White**: Team buffs, protection, resilience
- **Green**: Big creatures, ramp, growth

## Key Card Types

### Heroes
- **Primal Warlord** (RG): Aggressive growth hero with team buff ability
- **Wild Commander** (RWG): Team-wide buffs, scales with color diversity
- **Divine Protector** (W): Shields allies, defensive support

### Big Creatures (5-8 mana)

- **Wild Beast** (RG): 7/6 aggressive creature
- **Iron Golem** (RW): 5/8 defensive creature
- **Ancient Tree** (G): 6/9 resilient creature
- **Wild Colossus** (RRWW): 8/8 trample finisher
- **Ancient Titan** (G): 8/8 big finisher

### Rune-Consuming Buff Spells

- **Nature's Triumph** (RRGW, 6 mana): +2/+2 + permanent +2/+2 counters

### Artifacts
- **War Banner** (RW, 4 mana): +1 attack to all units

## Draft Strategy

### Early Picks (Heroes)
1. Prioritize RWG heroes or strong RG/GW heroes
2. Look for heroes with team buff abilities
3. Avoid overly complex heroes - simplicity is key

### Mid Picks (Creatures & Spells)
1. **Big Creatures**: Take 5-8 mana creatures aggressively
2. **Buff Spells**: Prioritize rune-consuming buffs, especially team-wide ones
3. **Rune Generators**: 1-2 artifacts to enable finishers (not critical early)

### Late Picks (Finishers)
1. **Rune Finishers**: Take powerful multicolor buff spells
2. **Biggest Creatures**: 7-8 mana finishers
3. **Support**: Fill out curve with 3-4 mana creatures

## Deck Building Guidelines

### Mana Curve
- **2-3 mana**: 2-4 cards (early plays, combat tricks)
- **4-5 mana**: 4-6 cards (midrange creatures, buffs)
- **6+ mana**: 6-8 cards (big creatures, finishers)

### Rune Requirements
- **Low-Medium**: 1-2 rune generators usually sufficient
- Most buff spells are 4-6 mana, requiring 2-4 runes
- 1-2 big finishers at 8-9 mana requiring 4+ runes
- Heroes provide some runes, artifacts fill the gap

### Card Distribution
- **Creatures**: 8-12 cards (focus on 5+ mana)
- **Spells**: 6-8 cards (mix of buffs and removal)
- **Artifacts**: 2-4 cards (1-2 rune generators, 1-2 utility)

## Matchup Considerations

### Favored Against
- **Aggro Decks**: Big creatures block well, buffs stabilize
- **Midrange Decks**: Bigger creatures win combat
- **Control Decks (without removal)**: Overwhelm with size

### Unfavored Against
- **Control Decks (with removal)**: Too many removal spells make big creatures inefficient
- **Combo Decks**: Can't interact with combos, lose to faster finishes
- **Tempo Decks**: Can fall behind before big creatures matter

## Design Philosophy

This archetype serves as a **baseline** for draft:
- **Accessible**: New players can draft it successfully
- **Reliable**: Consistent performance, less variance
- **Balanced**: Not overpowered, but always playable
- **Gateway**: Teaches fundamentals of creature combat and buffs

It's intentionally **simpler** than complex multicolor control decks, making it a good entry point while still being fun and effective.

## Example Deck (from draft)

**Heroes (5)**: Divine Protector, Primal Warlord x2, Battle Vanguard, Nature Warden

**Artifacts (3)**: Prismatic Generator, War Banner, Adaptive Generator (RW)

**Spells (7)**: Convergence Rally, Nature's Triumph, Into the Fray, Wrath of the Legion, Growth Rally, Primal Charge x2

**Units (10)**: Mix of 3-8 mana creatures including Wild Colossus, Ancient Titan, Raging Bear, Primal Banner

**Strategy**: Deploy big creatures, use rune generators to enable buff finishers, overwhelm with size and team-wide buffs.
