## Mana Curve Analysis

### UBG Ideal Curve
- **1-2 mana:** TBD cards (early blockers, rune generators)
- **3-4 mana:** TBD cards (removal, mid-game threats)
- **5-6 mana:** TBD cards (board wipes, finishers)
- **7+ mana:** Multicolor Wrath, Exorcism (game-enders)

### RW Ideal Curve
- **1-2 mana:** TBD cards (aggressive units)
- **3-4 mana:** Legion units, buffs
- **5+ mana:** Wrath of Legion (finisher)

---

## Rune Generation Analysis

### UBG Rune Needs

**For Key Spells:**
- Void Cascade (5UUB): Need 2 blue, 1 black
- Multicolor Wrath (6UUBBGG): Need 2 of each color
- Nature's Wisdom (2UG): Need 1 blue, 1 green
- Knowledge Seeker (5BB): Need 2 black

**Minimum Rune Requirements:**
- Blue: 2 (for Void Cascade)
- Black: 2 (for Knowledge Seeker, Void Cascade)
- Green: 2 (for Multicolor Wrath)

**Rune Artifacts Needed:** 3-5 artifacts to hit these requirements

**From Playtest 1:**
- Ended with 1 blue, 5 black, 6 green runes
- Too many runes → cards too easy to cast
- Stricter rune costs should fix this

## Balance Adjustments Log

| Date | Card | Change | Reason |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| 2025-12-25 | Void Cascade | 5 (UB) → 5UUB | Too easy to splash |
| 2025-12-25 | Multicolor Wrath | 6 (any 3) → 6UUBBGG | Too flexible |
| 2025-12-25 | Nature's Wisdom | 3UG → 2UG | Reduce mana, strict runes |
| 2025-12-25 | Knowledge Seeker | 4 → 5BB | Add black commitment |
| 2025-12-25 | Reflective Shield | 2 → 2U | Add blue requirement |
| 2025-12-25 | Arcane Burst | 4 → 4U | Add blue requirement |
| 2025-12-25 | Divine Protector | +1/+1 all → Range 2 +2 regen | Positional gameplay |
| 2025-12-25 | Guardian Angel | NEW | 3W, Adjacent +0/+2 |
| 2025-12-25 | Holy Sentinel | NEW | 4WW, Adjacent +0/+3 |
| 2025-12-25 | Fortified Bastion | NEW | 5WWW, Adjacent +0/+4 |

## Next Playtesting Goals

1. ✅ Test UBG with stricter rune requirements
2. ⏳ Test RW archetype (mirror match vs boss)
3. ⏳ Test RG archetype (midrange vs aggro)
4. ⏳ Test UB archetype (control vs aggro)
5. ⏳ Test GW archetype (midrange vs aggro)

**Target:** 5-10 playtests per archetype before major balance changes

---

## Statistical Targets

- **Win Rate:** 40-60% per archetype vs RW boss
- **Game Length:** 8-12 turns average
- **Pick Rate:** No card >80% or <10% (except situational cards)
- **Color Distribution:** 2-4 colors per deck typical
- **Rune Generation:** 2-4 rune artifacts typical

---

## Design Principles Confirmed

1. **Strict Rune Costs Enforce Color Identity** ✅
   - Cards with heavy rune requirements (UUBBGG) require real commitment
   - Prevents "goodstuff" piles
   
2. **Positional Gameplay Through Adjacency** ✅
   - White provides defensive adjacency buffs
   - Creates interesting positioning decisions ~30% of games

3. **Regeneration as "Save" Mechanic** ⏳
   - Divine Protector provides +2 regen in range 2
   - Needs playtesting to validate

4. **Battlefield Resolution Order** 💡
   - Noted for future: Alternating resolution (left-right, then right-left)
   - Creates strategic depth
