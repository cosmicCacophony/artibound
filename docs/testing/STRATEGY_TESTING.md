> **Notes:** Focused playtesting sessions for RW aggro strategies

## Overview

This document tracks focused playtesting sessions testing specific RW (Red/White) aggro strategies against UBG (Blue/Black/Green) control. The goal is to identify:
1. Which strategies are viable
2. What counterplay options exist
3. What items/cards would help balance these matchups

## Test Session 1: RW Tower Rush Strategy

### Strategy Description
**RW Goal:** Ignore enemy heroes entirely. Focus 100% on killing towers as fast as possible. Buy attack items to maximize tower damage.

### Test Setup
- **RW Player:** Play as aggressively as possible toward towers
- **UBG Player:** Play normally (control/defensive)
- **RW Item Priority:** Attack items only (Weapon, Broadsword, Blade of the Vigil, etc.)
- **RW Unit Priority:** Deploy to lanes where they can hit towers, ignore enemy heroes

### Key Questions
- [ ] Can RW win by turn 8-10 with pure tower focus?
- [ ] Does UBG have enough defensive tools to prevent tower death?
- [ ] Are attack items impactful enough for this strategy?
- [ ] Does ignoring enemy heroes create interesting tension?
- [ ] What happens when UBG tries to block with units?

## Test Session 2: RW Hero Hunter Strategy

### Strategy Description
**RW Goal:** Prioritize killing enemy multicolored heroes as #1 priority. Tower damage is #2 priority. Buy items that help kill heroes (attack items, cleave, etc.).

### Test Setup
- **RW Player:** Target enemy heroes first, especially multicolored ones. Only attack towers when heroes are dead or can't be reached.
- **UBG Player:** Play normally (control/defensive)
- **RW Item Priority:** Attack items that help kill heroes (Weapon, Broadsword, Blade of the Vigil for cleave, etc.)
- **RW Unit Priority:** Deploy to lanes with enemy heroes, position to kill them

### Key Questions
- [ ] Can RW win by killing all enemy heroes?
- [ ] Does killing heroes create enough advantage to win?
- [ ] Is UBG too vulnerable to hero removal?
- [ ] Does this strategy create interesting positioning decisions?
- [ ] What happens when UBG protects heroes with units?

## General Observations

### Positioning Relevance
- **Early Game (Turns 1-3):** [How relevant was positioning?]
- **Mid Game (Turns 4-6):** [How relevant was positioning?]
- **Late Game (Turns 7+):** [How relevant was positioning?]

**Notes:**
- 

**Future Consideration:** Should we add position-swapping abilities if positioning becomes more relevant later?

### Color Access Decisions
- **Did the turn 1 decision (spread vs. concentrate for color access) feel meaningful?**
- 

- **Did similar decisions come up later in the game?**
- 

### RW Archetype Identity
- **Does RW feel incentivized to kill towers?** [Yes / No / Sometimes]
- **Does RW feel incentivized to kill heroes?** [Yes / No / Sometimes]
- **Which feels more natural for RW?**
- 

### UBG Late Game Power
- **Did UBG's late game spells feel impactful?**
- 

- **Were they powerful enough to justify the setup cost?**
-

## Next Steps

After completing both test sessions:

1. **Document Findings:** Fill in all sections above
2. **Identify Balance Issues:** Which strategy is too strong/weak?
3. **Brainstorm Solutions:** Use the counterplay analysis section
4. **Design New Items/Cards:** Create specific items/cards to address issues
5. **Test Again:** Re-test with new items/cards

## Additional Test Ideas

### Test Session 3: Hybrid Strategy
**RW Goal:** Balance between killing heroes and towers based on board state
- Test if adaptive play is viable
- Compare to pure strategies

### Test Session 4: UBG Aggressive Strategy
**UBG Goal:** Try to win with UBG playing aggressively
- Test if UBG can be aggressive
- Identify what cards/items would help

### Test Session 5: Full Game (15+ Turns)
**Goal:** Play a complete game to see late game balance
- Test if positioning becomes more relevant
- Test late game spells and items
- See how games naturally conclude
