> **Date:** 2025-12-25  
> **Status:** In Progress  
> **Purpose:** Rebalance all heroes based on ability strength

## Rebalance Philosophy

**Tier 1: Strong Abilities → Low Stats**
- Target: 2/5, 1/6, 3/4, 2/6, 3/5
- Heroes with impactful abilities/support effects

**Tier 2: Weak/No Abilities → High Stats**
- Target: 4/6, 5/7, 3/8, 4/7
- Vanilla heroes or minor abilities

## Hero Audit (By Archetype)

### RW Heroes

| Hero | Current Stats | Ability Strength | Target Stats | Reason |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Legion Commander | 4/8 | Minor (+1/+1 Legion) | 3/6 | Minor ability, still tanky but not unkillable |
| Legion Captain | 4/9 | Minor (+1/+1 Legion) | 3/6 | Same as Commander |
| Cleave Warrior | 4/6 | Moderate (Cleave) | 3/5 | Cleave is strong, lower stats |

### UB Heroes

| Hero | Current Stats | Ability Strength | Target Stats | Reason |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| TBD | | | | |

### RG Heroes

| Hero | Current Stats | Ability Strength | Target Stats | Reason |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| TBD | | | | |

### GW/UW Heroes

| Hero | Current Stats | Ability Strength | Target Stats | Reason |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Divine Protector | 3/10 | Strong (Range 2 +2 regen) | 2/6 | Ability is the value, not stats |

### Combo Heroes

| Hero | Current Stats | Ability Strength | Target Stats | Reason |
|------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Storm Channeler | 3/7 | Strong (Rune to damage) | 2/5 | Strong ability, low stats |
| Echo Mage | 3/6 | Strong (Bounce + double dmg) | 2/5 | Strong ability, low stats |
| Aristocrat | ? | Strong (Sacrifice synergy) | 2/6 | Strong ability, keep alive to use |

## Implementation Plan

1. Grep for all hero definitions
2. Read each hero's abilities
3. Categorize (strong/weak/none)
4. Apply stat changes
5. Document in this file
