## Current Testing Status

### ✅ Tested Archetypes

1. **Grixis (UBR)** - Control/Spell-slinger
   - Status: "Didn't feel in a terrible spot"
   - Notes: Control deck with AOE and card advantage

2. **Bant (GWU)** - Midrange/Value
   - Status: "Seems kind of fun"
   - Notes: Midrange value deck

3. **GRw (Red-Green-White)** - Mighty Creatures + Barrier/Stun
   - Status: "Somewhat brainless" but barrier/stun is interesting
   - Notes: Just cast big units, but white splash adds barrier/stun mechanics

4. **GRb (Red-Green-Black)** - Mighty Creatures + Counter-Moving
   - Status: "Somewhat brainless" but counter-moving is interesting
   - Notes: Just cast big units, but black splash adds counter-moving mechanics

### 🎯 Key Insight
**GR variants feel "brainless"** - just cast big units. Need more flavor and decisions between GR vs splashing.

## Recommended Next Playtests

### Priority 1: RB (Red-Black) - Aggressive Spells-Matter ⭐⭐⭐

**Why This Should Be Next:**
- ✅ **Completely different playstyle** - Fast, spell-synergy based (contrasts with slower control/midrange)
- ✅ **Core archetype** - One of the main 2-color guilds
- ✅ **Tests new mechanics** - Spell triggers, direct tower damage, card draw from spells
- ✅ **Validates recent changes** - Tests new rune casting flexibility (spells can be cast where needed)
- ✅ **Different from tested** - Aggro vs control/midrange you've been playing

**What to Test:**
- Spell-synergy heroes (Spell Slinger, Pyromancer Prodigy)
- Cheap creatures (1-4 mana) that synergize with spells
- High spell volume (1-3 mana spells)
- Direct tower damage from spells

- Rune casting flexibility (can cast spells where needed)

**Key Questions:**
- Does the spell-synergy feel rewarding?

- Card advantage from clues and AOE
- More focused than Grixis (2-color vs 3-color)

---

### Priority 3: RW (Red-White) - Go-Wide Legion Aggro ⭐

**Why This Should Be Next:**
- ✅ **Boss archetype** - This is what the RW boss uses
- ✅ **Different from tested** - Go-wide tokens vs big creatures
- ✅ **Core archetype** - One of the main 2-color guilds
- ✅ **Tests token mechanics** - Legion tokens, team buffs

**What to Test:**
- Token generation (Legion Call, etc.)
- Team buffs (+1/+1, +2/+2 to all units)
- Go-wide strategy (many small units)
- Tower damage focus
- Rune casting flexibility

**Key Questions:**
- Does go-wide feel fun?
- Are team buffs impactful?

## Testing Strategy

### Recommended Order:

1. **RB (Red-Black)** - Test aggressive spell-synergy
2. **UB (Blue-Black)** - Test tempo control with stun/curse
3. **RW (Red-White)** - Test go-wide tokens (boss archetype)

### Why This Order:

1. **RB first** - Completely different from what you've tested (fast aggro vs slow control/midrange)
2. **UB second** - Tests recent changes (card advantage, curse mechanics)
3. **RW third** - Boss archetype, validates overall balance

### What to Focus On:

- **RB:** Spell-synergy feel, aggro balance, rune casting flexibility
- **UB:** Curse/stun mechanics, card advantage, control balance
- **RW:** Go-wide feel, team buffs, token mechanics

## Expected Outcomes

### If RB Feels Good:
- ✅ Spell-synergy archetype is viable
- ✅ Aggro has clear identity
- ✅ Rune casting flexibility helps aggro
- ✅ Different from RW (spell-synergy vs go-wide)

### If RB Needs Work:
- ⚠️ Spell triggers might need tuning
- ⚠️ Aggro might need more reach
- ⚠️ Rune casting might need adjustment

### If UB Feels Good:
- ✅ Curse/stun mechanics work
- ✅ Card advantage is sufficient
- ✅ Control has clear identity
- ✅ Different from Grixis (more focused)

### If UB Needs Work:
- ⚠️ Curse mechanics might need tuning
- ⚠️ Card advantage might need more options
- ⚠️ Control might need more finishers

---

## Next Steps After Testing

### If RB/UB Feel Good:
- Test RW (go-wide tokens)
- Compare all aggro archetypes (RB vs RW)
- Compare all control archetypes (UB vs Grixis)

### If RB/UB Need Work:
- Identify specific issues
- Design fixes (card changes, mechanic tweaks)
- Re-test after fixes

### If GR Variants Still Feel Brainless:
- Add more decision points to GR
- Consider adding more interesting mechanics
- Test GR vs GRw vs GRb differences
