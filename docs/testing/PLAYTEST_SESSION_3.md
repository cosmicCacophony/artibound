> **Result:** LOSS - RW Victory (not close)  
> **Status:** Completed

## Summary

Drafted UB spell-heavy control deck splashing green for direct damage and Titan's Wrath. Lost to RW Legion deck decisively. Key issue: didn't draw spell boosters early (Dark Archmage, Void Necromancer) and drew poorly overall. Legion Commander's buff effect proved very strong.

---

## Deck Composition

**Archetype:** UBg (Blue/Black Control splashing Green)

**Strategy:**
- Heavy spell focus
- Control through removal and direct damage
- Green splash for Titan's Wrath and direct damage spells
- Win condition: Outvalue opponent with spells + spell boosters

**Key Cards Drafted:**
- Spell boosters (Dark Archmage, Void Necromancer, etc.)
- UB removal spells
- Green direct damage (Titan's Wrath, others)
- Blue card draw

---

## Game Flow

### Early Game (Turns 1-4)
- **Issue:** Didn't draw spell boosters early
- **Issue:** Drew poorly overall
- **Result:** Fell behind on board

### Mid Game (Turns 5-8)
- **Observation:** Legion buffs were very strong
- **Result:** Couldn't catch up on board
- RW established strong board presence

### Late Game (Turns 9+)
- **Result:** Lost decisively
- Game wasn't close

---

## Key Observations

### 1. Legion Buff Power ⚠️

**Observation:** Legion Commander's buffs were VERY strong.

**Current Effect:** "Legion units get +1/+1" (or similar)

**Impact:**
- Tokens become significantly more threatening
- Hard to clear board when tokens are buffed
- Creates exponential value if not dealt with early

**Potential Issue:** 
- May be too strong if left unchecked
- Legion strategy might dominate if player can't answer it early
- Consider: Is the buff permanent or per-turn?

**Status:** 🔄 **Monitor in future games** - Need more data to determine if truly overpowered

---

### 2. UB Spell Deck Vulnerability ⚠️

**Issue:** UB spell-heavy deck struggled when spell boosters didn't show up early.

**Root Cause:**
- Heavy reliance on heroes/units that amplify spells
- Without them, spells alone aren't efficient enough
- Drew poorly and couldn't stabilize

**Archetype Weaknesses Exposed:**
- Needs specific heroes in play to function
- Vulnerable to bad draws
- May need more early-game defensive options

**Possible Solutions to Consider:**
- Add more cheap defensive units to UB
- Make some spells stronger baseline (less reliant on boosters)
- Add more card draw to find key pieces faster
- Consider: Are there enough 2-3 mana defensive units in UB?

---

### 3. Color Splash Viability

**Observation:** Green splash (UBg) seemed reasonable.

**Cards Used:**
- Titan's Wrath (big finisher)
- Green direct damage spells

**Assessment:**
- Splash worked mechanically
- May not have been optimal against go-wide strategy
- Titan's Wrath may be better vs. big units than tokens

**Status:** ✅ Splashing seems viable, but need to test more

---

## Cards That Worked Well

*(Track in future sessions)*
- Titan's Wrath (unclear if it resolved - note for next time)

---

## Cards That Felt Weak

**Spell-based strategy without boosters:**
- UB spells felt underwhelming without Dark Archmage/Necromancer in play
- May need baseline spell buffs or cheaper defensive options

---

## Cards That Felt Too Strong

**Legion Commander / Legion Buffs:**
- Legion buff effect was very impactful
- Created significant board advantage
- Difficult to clear buffed tokens

---

## Matchup Analysis

### UBg Control vs RW Legion

**Matchup Rating:** ⚠️ **Unfavorable for UBg**

**Why UBg Struggles:**
1. **Requires setup time:** Needs spell boosters in play
2. **Vulnerable to aggro:** Go-wide strategies punish slow starts
3. **AOE dependence:** Needs board clears to answer tokens
4. **Draw dependence:** Bad draws = auto-loss

**Why RW Legion Excels:**
1. **Consistent strategy:** Token generation + buffs always works
2. **Board pressure:** Forces opponent to have answers
3. **Snowball potential:** Buffs multiply token value
4. **Less draw-dependent:** Any units + buff = value

**How UBg Could Win:**
- Draw spell boosters early (turns 2-4)
- Have AOE ready for token waves
- Stabilize before buffs get out of hand
- Use Titan's Wrath or similar finisher after stabilizing

---

## Balance Questions Raised

### 1. Are Legion buffs too strong?

**Need to test:**
- How strong are Legion buffs against other archetypes?
- Can RG midrange handle it?
- Can GW defensive walls slow it down?
- Is it only UB control that struggles?

### 2. Is UB too reliant on spell boosters?

**Need to test:**
- Does UB need more early-game units?
- Should baseline spells be stronger?
- Are there enough defensive 2-3 mana units?
- Should Dark Archmage/Necromancer be higher pick priority?

### 3. Is go-wide too strong post-creep removal?

**Hypothesis:**
- Without creeps, going wide with tokens might be dominant
- Legion Call (create 2 1/1 tokens) + buffs = huge value
- May need more board clear options across archetypes

---

## Next Playtest Goals

1. **Test RW vs RW:** Can Legion mirror match give insights on its power level?
2. **Test RG vs RW:** Can big creatures race against tokens + buffs?
3. **Test GW vs RW:** Can defensive walls + buffs counter Legion?
4. **Track win rates:** Build dataset on archetype matchups
5. **Test UB with better draws:** Did bad luck skew results?

---

## Design Notes

### Post-Creep Removal Impact

**Hypothesis:** Removing auto-spawn creeps may have made go-wide strategies stronger.

**Reasoning:**
- Fewer blockers on board by default
- Easier to push damage with multiple small units
- Board clears are more valuable
- Token generation becomes more impactful

**Needs Testing:** 
- Are token generators too strong now?
- Do we need more baseline blockers?
- Should some heroes have "create blocker" abilities?

---

## Architecture Notes

**What Worked:**
- Draft system functional
- Game ran smoothly
- Card interactions worked

**What Could Be Better:**
- Track draw statistics (what cards were drawn when)
- Track hero deployment timing
- Log when key cards were played
- Automated win/loss recording

---

## Session Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Game Length** | ~8-10 turns (estimated) |
| **Final Result** | RW Victory (decisive) |
| **Closeness** | Not close |
| **Spell Boosters Drawn** | Late/Never (bad luck) |
| **Board Clears Used** | Unknown (track next time) |

---

## Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Test RW vs other archetypes (RG, GW)
- [ ] Monitor Legion buff power level
- [ ] Consider adding more UB early-game defense

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Track card draw timing in future sessions
- [ ] Test UB with good draws (see if archetype is viable)
- [ ] Evaluate if Titan's Wrath is good vs go-wide

### Low Priority
- [ ] Consider baseline spell buffs for UB
- [ ] Evaluate token generation power level
- [ ] Test if more board clears are needed

---

## Matchup Matrix (Updated)

| Attacker ↓ / Defender → | RW Legion |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| **UBG Control** (Session 1) | TIE |
| **UBg Spells** (Session 3) | **LOSS** |
| **RW Aggro** | ? |
| **RG Midrange** | ? |
| **GW Defense** | ? |

**Pattern Emerging:** UB control variants may struggle vs RW Legion

---

## Next Session Focus

**Primary Question:** Is RW Legion too strong, or did UBg just have bad luck?

**Test Plan:**
1. RG Midrange vs RW Legion (big units vs tokens)
2. GW Defense vs RW Legion (walls + buffs vs tokens + buffs)
3. RW Aggro vs RW Legion (mirror match insights)

**Success Criteria:**
- If all archetypes lose to RW Legion → Legion needs nerfs
- If only UB loses → UB needs early-game help
- If results are mixed → Current balance is reasonable

---

## Conclusion

UBg spell control lost decisively to RW Legion. Key factors:
1. Didn't draw spell boosters early
2. Drew poorly overall
3. Legion buffs were very strong
4. Couldn't stabilize or catch up

**Verdict:** Need more data to determine if this was bad luck (poor draws) or a fundamental archetype weakness. Legion buffs are strong and should be monitored.

**Recommended Next Step:** Test RG/GW vs RW to see if the issue is RW being too strong or UB being too weak.
