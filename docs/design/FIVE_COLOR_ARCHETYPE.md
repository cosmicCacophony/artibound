# 5-Color "Good Stuff" Archetype Design

> **Created:** 2025-01-XX  
> **Status:** Active  
> **Relevance:** High  
> **Category:** Design  
> **Notes:** Design for 5-color "good stuff" archetype - maximum flexibility, highest ceiling

## Overview

A 5-color "good stuff" archetype that plays the best cards from every color. This should be a **high-ceiling, high-risk** archetype that requires early commitment but rewards players with access to the most powerful cards.

## Design Philosophy: High-Roll Archetype

### Core Principle
**5-color should be enabled by drafting specific powerful artifacts early, not by making one color naturally good at generating any-color runes.**

### Why High-Roll (Artifact-Based) is Better

#### ✅ Advantages of Artifact-Based Approach
1. **Feels Special**: When it comes together, it's exciting and memorable
2. **Draft Tension**: Creates meaningful early decisions - do you commit to 5-color?
3. **Prevents Over-Saturation**: Won't be too common if it requires specific cards
4. **Higher Ceiling**: Rewards players who identify the opportunity early
5. **Clear Identity**: 5-color is "the artifact deck" - distinct from other archetypes
6. **Balanced Risk/Reward**: High risk (needs artifacts) = high reward (best cards)

#### ❌ Problems with Color-Based Approach
1. **Too Easy**: If one color naturally generates any-color runes, 5-color becomes too accessible
2. **Reduces Tension**: No meaningful decision - just pick that color
3. **Over-Saturation**: Everyone would draft 5-color if it's too easy
4. **Reduces Archetype Diversity**: One color becomes "the 5-color color"
5. **Lower Skill Expression**: Less draft skill required

## Enabling Mechanisms

### Option 1: Premium Any-Color Artifacts (Recommended)

**Require 2-3 "any color" artifacts to enable 5-color:**

- **Prismatic Generator** (5 mana, colorless): Generate 1 rune of any color ✅ Exists
- **Universal Mana Rock** (6 mana, colorless): Generate 1 rune of any color ✅ Exists
- **Chromatic Seal** (5 mana, any color): Generate 1 rune of any color (to be created)
- **Rainbow Prism** (4 mana, colorless): Generate 1 rune of any color (to be created - premium)

**Draft Strategy:**
- **Early Picks (1-4)**: If you see 2+ any-color artifacts, consider 5-color
- **Mid Picks (5-12)**: Commit to 5-color if you have artifacts, take best cards from all colors
- **Late Picks (13-18)**: Fill out curve, take powerful multicolor finishers

**Rune Requirements:**
- **Minimum**: 2 any-color artifacts (enables 3-4 colors reliably)
- **Optimal**: 3-4 any-color artifacts (enables 5 colors reliably)
- **Heroes**: 4 heroes from different colors (1 rune each = 4 base runes)
- **Total**: 4 base runes + 2-4 any-color runes = 6-8 runes per turn

### Option 2: 5-Color Enabler Hero (Alternative)

**A hero that generates any-color runes:**

- **Chromatic Hero** (5 colors, 3/10): 
  - **Ability**: "At the start of your turn, add 1 rune of any color to your rune pool."
  - **Support Effect**: "You can play cards of any color."
  - **Signature**: Powerful 5-color spell

**Pros:**
- Clear signal for 5-color archetype
- Provides both rune generation and color access

**Cons:**
- Makes 5-color too easy (just pick this hero)
- Reduces draft tension
- Less interesting than artifact-based approach

**Recommendation**: **Don't use this approach** - it makes 5-color too accessible and reduces draft skill.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

**Combine artifacts with a 5-color payoff hero:**

- **Artifacts**: 2-3 any-color artifacts required (enables rune generation)
- **Hero**: 5-color payoff hero that rewards having 5 colors (not enables it)
  - **Example**: "If you control heroes of 5 different colors, all your units gain +2/+2"
  - **Does NOT generate runes** - just provides payoff for committing to 5 colors

**This approach:**
- ✅ Requires artifacts (draft skill)
- ✅ Provides payoff for committing (reward)
- ✅ Creates tension (do you commit early?)
- ✅ Feels special when it comes together

## Archetype Characteristics

### Strengths
- **Best Cards**: Access to the most powerful cards from every color
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to any matchup
- **High Ceiling**: When it comes together, extremely powerful
- **Unique**: Distinct from other archetypes

### Weaknesses
- **High Risk**: Requires specific artifacts early
- **Inconsistent**: Can fail if you don't get artifacts
- **Slow**: Artifacts cost 4-6 mana, delays threats
- **Vulnerable**: If opponent removes artifacts, deck falls apart

### Mana Curve
- **Early (1-3 mana)**: Generic cards, removal, card draw
- **Mid (4-6 mana)**: Any-color artifacts, powerful multicolor cards
- **Late (7-9 mana)**: Best finishers from all colors

### Rune Strategy
- **Early**: Draft any-color artifacts aggressively
- **Mid**: Take best cards from all colors
- **Late**: Fill out curve, prioritize powerful finishers

## Draft Tension & Decision Points

### Early Draft (Picks 1-4)
**Decision**: Do I see enough any-color artifacts to commit to 5-color?

**Signals:**
- ✅ 2+ any-color artifacts in first 4 picks → Consider 5-color
- ❌ 0-1 any-color artifacts → Stay flexible, don't commit

**Risk:**
- If you commit but don't get more artifacts, you're stuck with weak deck
- If you don't commit but get artifacts later, you miss the opportunity

### Mid Draft (Picks 5-12)
**Decision**: Am I committed to 5-color, or should I pivot?

**If Committed:**
- Take best cards from all colors
- Prioritize powerful multicolor spells
- Fill out curve with efficient cards

**If Not Committed:**
- Stay in 2-3 colors
- Don't take off-color cards
- Focus on archetype-specific cards

### Late Draft (Picks 13-18)
**Decision**: Fill out curve and take finishers

**If 5-Color:**
- Take powerful finishers from any color
- Fill out curve with efficient cards
- Ensure you have enough threats

**If Not 5-Color:**
- Stay on-color
- Take archetype-specific cards
- Avoid off-color cards

## Card Requirements
