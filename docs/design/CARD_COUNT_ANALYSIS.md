# Card Count Analysis: Is 199 Cards Enough?

> **Created:** 2025-01-XX  
> **Status:** Analysis  
> **Purpose:** Determine if 199 cards is appropriate for current game structure

---

## Current State

- **Total Cards:** 199 (units + spells, excluding heroes and artifacts)
- **Target:** Under 200 cards
- **Removed:** 28 generic cards across 3 rounds
- **Moved:** 2 cards (Cleaving Warrior & Berserker → RG)

---

## Draft Structure Analysis

### Draft Parameters
- **Total Packs:** 18 packs
- **Picks per Pack:** 2 cards
- **Total Picks:** 36 cards (4 heroes + 32 other cards)
- **Color Weighting:** 70% matching player colors, 30% random

### Draft Math
- **Cards Seen:** ~36 picks from 199 card pool
- **Percentage of Pool:** ~18% of total cards seen per draft
- **Cards per Two-Color Pair:** If evenly distributed, ~2-3 cards per pair seen
- **With Color Weighting:** ~4-5 cards for your colors per draft

---

## Target Distribution (From Guild System Docs)

### Two-Color Pairs (10 pairs)
- **Target:** 15-20 playable cards per pair
- **Total Target:** 150-200 cards
- **Current:** ~199 cards total (includes three-color guilds)

### Three-Color Guilds (5 guilds)
- **Target:** 5-10 cards per guild
- **Total Target:** 25-50 cards

### Combined Target
- **Ideal Range:** 175-250 cards
- **Current:** 199 cards
- **Status:** ✅ Within target range

---

## Consistency Analysis

### For "Constructed Feel with Consistent Paths"

**What We Need:**
1. **Enough cards per archetype** - Players can reliably get 10-15 cards for their guild
2. **Clear archetype identity** - Every card clearly supports a guild
3. **Variety without dilution** - Enough options but not so many that archetypes blur

**Current State:**
- **199 cards ÷ 10 pairs = ~20 cards per pair** (if evenly distributed)
- **With 70% color weighting:** Players see ~4-5 cards for their colors per draft
- **Over 18 packs:** Players can build focused 10-15 card archetype decks

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Enough cards per archetype** - ~20 per pair is solid
- ⚠️ **Archetype clarity** - Need to verify all 199 cards clearly support guilds
- ⚠️ **Distribution balance** - Some pairs might have more/less than others

---

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Keep at 199 (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Just under 200 target
- ✅ Enough variety for interesting drafts
- ✅ Enough cards per archetype (~20 per pair)
- ✅ Allows for some flexibility and pivoting

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to verify all cards clearly support archetypes
- ⚠️ Some pairs might be over/under represented

**Action Items:**
- Verify distribution is balanced across pairs
- Ensure all remaining cards clearly support guilds
- Consider minor trimming if some pairs are bloated

---

### Option 2: Trim to ~175-180
**Pros:**
- ✅ Tighter, more focused card pool
- ✅ Higher consistency in drafts
- ✅ Stronger archetype identity (fewer generic cards)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less variety - drafts might feel repetitive
- ⚠️ Harder to pivot between archetypes
- ⚠️ Might feel too "solved" or predictable

**When to Choose:**
- If you want maximum consistency
- If drafts feel too random currently
- If archetypes still feel diluted

---

### Option 3: Stay at 199, Focus on Quality
**Pros:**
- ✅ Good balance of variety and consistency
- ✅ Room for some flexibility
- ✅ Not too restrictive

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to ensure all 199 cards are high quality
- ⚠️ Need to verify distribution is balanced

**Action Items:**
- Review remaining cards for archetype support
- Balance distribution across pairs
- Remove any remaining generic cards
- Ensure each pair has ~15-20 strong cards

---

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Are all 199 cards clearly supporting archetypes?**
   - If no → Trim more generic cards
   - If yes → 199 is good

2. **Is distribution balanced?**
   - Check if some pairs have 25+ cards while others have <15
   - If unbalanced → Redistribute or trim bloated pairs

3. **Do drafts feel consistent?**
   - Can players reliably build their archetype?
   - If no → Trim more or adjust distribution
   - If yes → 199 is good

4. **Is there enough variety?**
   - Do drafts feel repetitive?
   - If yes → Keep 199 or add a few more
   - If no → 199 is good

---

## My Recommendation

**Keep at 199, but verify quality and distribution.**

**Reasoning:**
1. **199 is a good number** - Just under 200, within target range
2. **Draft math works** - With 70% color weighting, players can build focused decks
3. **Room for flexibility** - Allows pivoting and variety without being too random
4. **Quality over quantity** - Better to have 199 great cards than 250 mediocre ones

**Next Steps:**
1. **Verify distribution** - Check if all 10 pairs have ~15-20 cards
2. **Quality check** - Ensure all remaining cards clearly support archetypes
3. **Minor trimming** - If some pairs are bloated (>25 cards), trim to balance
4. **Test drafts** - Playtest to see if consistency feels right

**If after verification you find:**
- **Many generic cards remaining** → Trim to ~175-180
- **Unbalanced distribution** → Redistribute or trim bloated pairs
- **All cards support archetypes, distribution is balanced** → 199 is perfect

---

## Conclusion

**199 cards is likely appropriate IF:**
- All cards clearly support archetypes
- Distribution is balanced (~15-20 per two-color pair)
- Drafts feel consistent but not repetitive

**Consider trimming to ~175-180 IF:**
- Many generic cards remain
- Drafts feel too random
- You want maximum consistency

**My vote: Keep at 199, but do a quality/distribution audit first.**
