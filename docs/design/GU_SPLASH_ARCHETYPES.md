## GU + Black Splash (GUB) - Exorcism Build

**Reference Deck:** `saved-drafts/gu-splash-ubgw-example.json`

### Strategy
Start with blue spell damage artifacts, prioritize spell damage, then splash black for Exorcism and additional control tools.

### Key Splash Cards

#### Exorcism (7 mana, UBG)
- **Effect**: Deal 12 total damage distributed to enemy units in front and tower
- **Requires**: All 3 colors (UBG) - consumes U, G, B runes
- **Why it works**: GU base provides U and G, only need to splash B
- **Positioning**: Most efficient with 0-1 units in range (full 12 to tower)

#### Supporting Black Cards
- **Void Druid** (UBG hero): Combines UB control with Green resilience
  - Support: "When you cast a spell, draw a card. If you control heroes of 4 different colors, draw 2 cards instead."
- **Nature's Guardian** (5 mana, GU): ETB buff - "When this enters, all your units gain +1/+1 until end of turn"
- **Shadow Growth Artifact** (4 mana, BG): "When a unit dies, gain +1 max mana"

### Draft Priority
1. **Early**: Blue spell damage artifacts (Divine Wrath, Void Generator)
2. **Mid**: Blue removal spells (Arcane Removal, Light Strike Array)
3. **Late**: Exorcism + supporting black cards
4. **Finisher**: Colossus (9 mana green finisher)

### Color Requirements
