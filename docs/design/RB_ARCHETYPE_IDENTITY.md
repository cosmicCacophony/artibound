## RB Archetype Identity

### Core Philosophy
**RB should be the main aggro deck** - Fast, aggressive, go under opponents before they turn the tides with big spells.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Low Rune Requirements**
   - One RB hero max (rune restrictions shouldn't be high)
   - Less cards that require runes
   - More vanilla beaters (generic cards without rune costs)
   - Focus on speed, not rune complexity

2. **Single-Color Hero Focus**
   - Prefer 4 single-color heroes (Red or Black) with abilities
   - Allows flexible deployment without rune constraints
   - Heroes provide abilities, not rune generation
   - Go under opponents before big spells matter

3. **Aggressive Strategy**
   - Fast, proactive gameplay
   - Direct tower damage
   - Efficient creatures (vanilla beaters)
   - Spell-synergy as secondary (not primary)

4. **Speed Over Complexity**
   - Win fast or lose
   - Don't need complex rune setups
   - Simple, aggressive game plan
   - Beat opponents before they stabilize

## RB Card Philosophy

### What RB Should Have

1. **Vanilla Beaters**
   - Generic cards without rune costs
   - Efficient stats (2/2 for 2, 3/3 for 3, 4/4 for 4)
   - Simple, aggressive creatures

2. **Low Rune Requirements**
   - Most cards should be generic (no rune costs)
   - Only key spells need runes
   - Don't require complex rune setups

3. **Direct Damage**
   - Spells that deal tower damage
   - Burn spells (1-3 mana)
   - Quick removal (2-3 mana)

4. **Spell-Synergy (Secondary)**
   - Some spell triggers (cast spell → effect)
   - Not the primary focus
   - Speed is more important

### What RB Should NOT Have

1. **Heavy Rune Requirements**
   - Avoid cards that need 2+ runes
   - Don't require RB hero in lane
   - Keep it simple

2. **Complex Mechanics**
   - Avoid counter systems
   - Avoid complex triggers
   - Keep it fast and simple

3. **Slow Cards**
   - Avoid expensive cards (6+ mana)
   - Focus on 1-4 mana curve
   - Speed is key

## Design Questions

### Do We Have 4 Single-Color Heroes for RB?

**Red Heroes:**
- ✅ Spell Slinger (Red) - Good
- ✅ Pyromancer Prodigy (Red) - Good
- ✅ Cleave Warrior (Red) - Good
- ⚠️ Blaze Champion (Red) - Maybe too complex?

**Black Heroes:**
- ❓ Need to check existing black heroes
- Need 2-3 aggressive black heroes

### What Black Heroes Fit RB Aggro?

**Potential Black Hero Abilities:**
- Direct damage (deal X damage to tower)
- Card draw (draw a card when...)
- Removal (destroy target unit with X or less health)
- Aggressive stats (high attack, low health)
- Simple triggers (when you cast a spell...)

**Avoid:**
- Blood Magic (too complex)
- Sacrifice mechanics (too slow)
- Complex counter systems
- Slow value engines

---

## Recommendations

### If We Need More Heroes:

1. **Add 1-2 Aggressive Black Heroes**
   - Simple abilities (tower damage, card draw, removal)
   - Aggressive stats (3/2, 4/3, etc.)
   - Fast, proactive abilities

2. **Consider Replacing Blaze Champion**
   - If counter system is too complex
   - Replace with simpler red hero
   - Focus on speed over complexity

3. **Ensure 4 Single-Color Heroes Total**
   - 3 Red + 1 Black OR
   - 2 Red + 2 Black OR
   - 4 Red (if black heroes don't fit)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Check existing black heroes** - Do they fit RB aggro?
2. **Identify gaps** - Do we need more aggressive black heroes?
3. **Design new heroes if needed** - Simple, aggressive abilities
4. **Test RB archetype** - Validate hero lineup and card pool

*RB should feel fast, aggressive, and simple. Focus on speed over complexity, vanilla beaters over rune-heavy cards, and single-color heroes over dual-color heroes.*
