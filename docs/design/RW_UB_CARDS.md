4. **Card Advantage**: Control decks gain value through draw and removal (UB archetype)
5. **Tower Interaction**: Some cards can target towers directly (Lightning Strike, Tower Destroyer)
6. **Death Triggers**: Units that provide value when they die (Relentless Zombie, Shadow Assassin)
7. **AOE Effects**: Board-wide damage and buffs (Tower Barrage, Rally Banner)

### Cost Structure:
