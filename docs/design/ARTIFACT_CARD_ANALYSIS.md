# Artifact Foundry → Artibound Card Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes Artifact Foundry cards for potential porting to Artibound, organized by power level and color requirements.

**Design Principles:**
- Lower mana (1-3) = Single color (easier to cast early)
- Medium mana (4-5) = Dual color (requires some setup)
- High mana (6-8) = Triple color (requires positioning/bouncing)
- Power level determines exact color requirements

## Blue Cards (U) - AOE & Control

### 1. AOE Damage Spells

#### **4 Mana: Deal 6 damage evenly divided to target and adjacent units**
**Artifact**: Strong 4-mana AOE
**Power Level**: Medium-High
**Artibound Design:**

**Dual Color (UB) - 4 mana**
- Effect: Deal 6 damage evenly divided to target unit and adjacent units
- Distribution: 0 units = 6 to tower, 1 unit = 3+3, 2 units = 2+2+2, 3 units = 2+2+2
- Rationale: Strong but not game-changing, dual color requirement balances it

---

#### **3 Mana: Deal 2 damage to all enemies in lane**
**Artifact**: Standard 3-mana AOE
**Power Level**: Medium
**Artibound Design:**
- **3 mana, Single color (U)**
- Effect: Deal 2 damage to all enemy units in target battlefield
- Rationale: Standard AOE, accessible early game, single color appropriate

---

#### **4 Mana: Deal 3 damage to all enemies in lane**
**Artifact**: Strong 4-mana AOE
**Power Level**: Medium-High
**Artibound Design:**
- **4 mana, Dual color (UB)**
- Effect: Deal 3 damage to all enemy units in target battlefield
- Rationale: Stronger than 2 damage version, dual color requirement balances power

---

### 2. Targeted Damage Spells

#### **2 Mana: Deal 2 damage to all units in lane, they take 2 decay damage in combat**
**Artifact**: Strong 2-mana spell with conditional upgrade
**Power Level**: Medium (base), High (with Black hero)
**Artibound Design:**

**Dual Color (UB) - 2 mana**
- Effect: Deal 2 damage to all enemy units in target battlefield. Those units take +2 damage in combat this turn.
- If you control a Black hero: Deal 4 damage instead of 2.
- Rationale: Always requires UB, but stronger with Black hero synergy

---

### 3. Enchantment (Stays in Base)

#### **6 Mana Enchantment: 1 mana ability, 1 round cooldown, deal 4 damage to any unit**
**Artifact**: Very powerful control tool
**Power Level**: Very High
**Artibound Design:**

**Triple Color (UBG) - 6 mana**
- Enchantment stays in base (like Artifact)
- Activated ability: Pay 1 mana, deal 4 damage to target unit (1 round cooldown)
- Rationale: Very powerful, requires all 3 colors, justifies setup cost

---

### 4. Charge-Based Spell

#### **5 Mana: Deal 2 damage per charge, charges generated by specific hero**
**Artifact**: Strong 5-mana spell with setup requirement
**Power Level**: High
**Artibound Design:**

**Triple Color (UBG) - 5 mana**
- Effect: Deal 2 damage per charge to random enemy units on target battlefield
- Charges: Generated by specific hero ability (e.g., "At start of turn, if this hero is on board, add 1 charge")
- Rationale: Very powerful with charges, triple color requirement prevents abuse

---

## Green Cards (G) - Defensive & Buffs

### 1. Buff Spells

#### **3 Mana: Give two units in any lanes +2/+2**
**Artifact**: Strong defensive buff
**Power Level**: Medium
**Artibound Design:**

**Single Color (G) - 3 mana**
- Effect: Target two units (can be in different battlefields), give them +2/+2 permanently
- Rationale: Good defensive tool, single color keeps it accessible

---

### 2. Defensive Units

#### **3 Mana: 2/3 unit, give adjacent units death shield**
**Artifact**: Defensive support unit
**Power Level**: Medium
**Artibound Design:**

**Simplified Version:**
- **3 mana, Single color (G) - 2/3 unit**
- Effect: Adjacent units gain +5/+5 until they die (simpler than death shield)
- Rationale: Strong defensive tool, but single color keeps it accessible

---

## Black Cards (B) - Removal & Disruption

### 1. Hero Removal

#### **4 Mana: Kill a hero and discard a random card**
**Artifact**: Strong removal with card advantage
**Power Level**: High
**Artibound Design:**

**Dual Color (UB) - 4 mana**
- Effect: Destroy target hero. Opponent discards a random card.
- Rationale: Very powerful removal, dual color requirement balances it

---

### 2. Damage Spells

#### **3 Mana: Deal 3 damage and get initiative**
**Artifact**: Good removal with tempo
**Power Level**: Medium
**Artibound Design:**

**Single Color (B) - 3 mana**
- Effect: Deal 3 damage to target unit. You get initiative (play next card first).
- Rationale: Good removal, initiative is nice bonus, single color keeps it accessible

---

### 3. Positioning Spells

#### **1 Mana: Move hero in front of a unit in a different lane**
**Artibound**: Very cheap positioning tool
**Power Level**: Low-Medium
**Artibound Design:**

**Single Color (B) - 1 mana**
- Effect: Move target hero to be directly in front of target unit in different battlefield
- Rationale: Cheap positioning, single color keeps it accessible

---

### 4. Combat Setup Spells

#### **2 Mana: Give hero invulnerable, reflect damage back to source**
**Artifact**: Strong combat trick
**Power Level**: Medium-High (situational)
**Artibound Design:**

**Single Color (B) - 2 mana**
- Effect: Target hero gains invulnerable this turn. Any damage that hero would take is reflected back to the source.
- Rationale: Very powerful in specific situations (heroes in front of each other), but weak otherwise. Single color keeps it accessible early game.

**Use Case:**
- Turn 1: Heroes in front of each other
- Cast on weaker hero before combat
- Stronger hero attacks, takes reflected damage, dies
- Weaker hero survives, wins the trade

**Example:**
```
RW: 5/8 hero attacks UB: 3/6 hero (with invulnerable)
- UB hero takes 0 damage (invulnerable)
- RW hero takes 5 damage (reflected) → RW hero dies!
- UB wins trade with 2-mana spell
```

**Recommendation**: **Single Color (B, 2 mana)** - Perfect early game combat trick that creates interesting decisions. See `EARLY_GAME_DECISIONS.md` for strategic analysis.

### 5. Chain Damage Spell

#### **6 Mana: Deal 2 damage to unit, then random jump left/right 6 times, deal 2 damage if legal target**
**Artifact**: Very powerful chain damage
**Power Level**: Very High
**Artibound Design:**

**Triple Color (UBG) - 6 mana**
- Effect: Deal 2 damage to target unit. Then, randomly jump to adjacent slot (left or right) 6 times. Each time, if there's a unit there, deal 2 damage to it.
- Rationale: Very powerful, can deal up to 14 damage (2 + 6×2), triple color requirement balances it

---

### 6. First Strike Unit

#### **5 Mana: 6/4 unit with first strike**
**Artifact**: Strong aggressive unit
**Power Level**: High
**Artibound Design:**

**Dual Color (RB or UB) - 5 mana**
- Stats: 6/4
- Effect: First strike (deals damage first in combat, if enemy dies, enemy doesn't deal damage back)
- Rationale: Very strong combat unit, dual color balances it

**Note**: You mentioned keeping RW as 2 colors, so RB would be a different archetype. Could also be UB if it fits control better.

## Design Notes

### AOE Damage Distribution

**Pattern from Exorcism:**
- 0 units: Full damage to tower
- 1 unit: Half to unit, half to tower
- 2 units: 1/3 to each unit, 1/3 to tower
- 3 units: 1/4 to each unit, 1/4 to tower

**Apply to 6-damage AOE:**
- 0 units: 6 to tower
- 1 unit: 3 to unit, 3 to tower
- 2 units: 2 to each unit, 2 to tower
- 3 units: 2 to each unit, 0 to tower (or 1.5 each, but we'll round to 2)

### Initiative System

**In Artibound:**
- Initiative determines who plays next card
- Some spells give initiative
- Can be powerful for tempo

### First Strike Mechanic

**In Artibound:**
- Unit deals damage first
- If enemy dies, enemy doesn't deal damage back
- Very powerful for trading favorably

### Charge System

**Design Considerations:**
- Charges accumulate over time
- Requires hero on board to generate charges
- Can be very powerful if unchecked
- Triple color requirement prevents abuse
