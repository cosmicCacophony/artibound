# Rock-Paper-Scissors Archetype System

> **Created:** 2024-12-15  
> **Status:** Active  
> **Relevance:** High  
> **Category:** Design  
> **Notes:** Core RPS archetype system for balanced gameplay

## Overview

A rock-paper-scissors (RPS) archetype system creates natural balance through matchup dynamics:

- **Aggro beats Control** (too fast, control can't stabilize)
- **Control beats Midrange** (outvalues, answers threats efficiently)
- **Midrange beats Aggro** (stabilizes, survives early pressure)

This system ensures that no single archetype dominates and creates interesting draft decisions.

## Rune System Integration

**Critical**: The rune system is central to deck building and enables splashing powerful spells.

### How Runes Enable Splashing
- **Heroes** provide base runes (1 rune per color when deployed)
- **Rune Artifacts** enable splashing by generating additional runes
- **More artifacts = more splashing** = access to powerful multicolor spells

### Rune Artifact Strategy by Archetype

**Aggro (Mono Red)**:
- **Generally**: 0-1 rune artifacts (prioritize threats on board)
- **Exception**: 1-2 artifacts if drafting:
  - Big finishers (Time of Triumph, 9RRRR)
  - Early spells that consume runes
- **Philosophy**: Race, not ramp - put threats on board

**Control (UG + Splashes)**:
- **Generally**: 2-4 rune artifacts (enable splashing)
- **Purpose**: Access to powerful finishers (Exorcism, etc.)
- **Philosophy**: Invest in rune generation to unlock splash colors

**Midrange (Black + 3-4 Colors)**:
- **Generally**: 3-5 rune artifacts (maximum flexibility)
- **Purpose**: Enable 3-4 color strategies
- **Philosophy**: Rune artifacts are essential for multicolor payoffs

## The Three Core Archetypes

### 1. Aggro - Mono Red with Light Splashes

**Base Color**: Red (mono)  
**Splash Options**: 1-2 colors (White, Black, or Green)  
**Total Colors**: 1-2 colors max

#### Design Philosophy
- **Fast**: Win by turn 6-8
- **Tower-focused**: Direct damage to towers
- **Low curve**: Most cards cost 1-4 mana
- **Combat-focused**: Units with high attack, low health
- **Light splashes**: Only for specific powerful effects, not core strategy

#### Key Characteristics
- **Mana Curve**: Heavy on 1-3 mana cards, few 4+ mana cards
- **Win Condition**: Tower damage, not board control
- **Splash Purpose**: 
  - **White**: Combat tricks, protection, +1/+1 buffs
  - **Black**: Direct damage spells, removal
  - **Green**: Haste units, aggressive ramp (unlikely but possible)

#### Example Splash Combinations
- **R** (Mono Red): Pure aggression, no splash
- **RW** (Red/White): Combat tricks, team buffs
- **RB** (Red/Black): Removal, direct damage
- **RG** (Red/Green): Haste, aggressive ramp (rare)

#### Key Cards Needed
**Mono Red Core:**
- Low-cost aggressive units (1-3 mana, 3+ attack)
- Direct damage spells (2-3 mana, 4-6 damage)
- Combat tricks (1-2 mana, +2/+2 or similar)
- Tower-focused units (can attack towers directly)

**White Splash:**
- Combat tricks (1-2 mana, protection or buffs)
- Team buffs (3-4 mana, +1/+1 to all units)
- Low-cost defensive units (2-3 mana, 2/3 or 2/4)

**Black Splash:**
- Removal spells (2-3 mana, kill small units)
- Direct damage (2-3 mana, 4-5 damage)
- Aggressive units with sacrifice effects (3-4 mana)

#### Draft Strategy
1. **Early**: Prioritize mono-red aggressive units and spells
2. **Mid**: If white/black cards are strong, consider light splash
3. **Late**: Avoid high-cost cards, maintain low curve

### 2. Control - UG (Green/Blue) with Splashes

**Base Colors**: Green/Blue (GU)  
**Splash Options**: 1-2 colors (Black, White, or Red)  
**Total Colors**: 2-3 colors

- **Splash Purpose**: Access to powerful finishers (Exorcism, etc.)

#### Key Characteristics
- **Mana Curve**: Heavy on 4-7 mana cards, ramp early
- **Win Condition**: Card advantage, board control, big finishers
- **Splash Purpose**:
  - **Black**: Exorcism, additional removal, card draw
  - **White**: Protection, resilient threats, board wipes
  - **Red**: Burn finishers (unlikely but possible)

#### Example Splash Combinations

**White Splash (GUW):**
- Protection spells (2-3 mana, protect units)
- Resilient threats (5-6 mana, high health)
- Board wipes (6-7 mana, conditional wipes)

**Red Splash (GUR):**

- Aggressive threats (5-6 mana, high attack)

#### Draft Strategy
1. **Early**: Prioritize GU ramp and removal
2. **Mid**: Choose splash color based on available finishers

### 3. Midrange - Black as Main Color, 3-4 Colors

**Base Color**: Black

## Matchup Dynamics

### Aggro vs Control
**Aggro Wins** ✅
- **Why**: Too fast, control can't stabilize
- **Key Cards**: Low-cost threats, direct damage
- **Strategy**: Pressure early, ignore board control

### Control vs Midrange
**Control Wins** ✅
- **Why**: Outvalues, answers threats efficiently
- **Key Cards**: Removal, card draw, board wipes
- **Strategy**: Survive early, outvalue late

### Midrange vs Aggro
**Midrange Wins** ✅
- **Why**: Stabilizes, survives early pressure
- **Key Cards**: Efficient blockers, removal, life gain
- **Strategy**: Survive early, win with better cards

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Define Archetypes (Current)
- ✅ Create design document
- ⚠️ Define card requirements for each archetype
- ⚠️ Identify missing cards

### Phase 2: Create Missing Cards
**Aggro (Mono Red + Splashes):**
- [ ] Low-cost aggressive units (1-3 mana)
- [ ] Direct damage spells (2-3 mana)
- [ ] Combat tricks (1-2 mana)
- [ ] Tower-focused units

**Control (GU + Splashes):**
- [ ] GU base cards (mostly exist)
- [ ] GUB finishers (Exorcism exists ✅)
- [ ] GUW finishers (needs creation)
- [ ] GUR finishers (needs creation)

**Midrange (Black + 3-4 Colors):**
- [ ] Black core cards (efficient removal, card draw)
- [ ] Multicolor value cards (BG, BU, BR, BW)
- [ ] 3-4 color payoff cards

### Phase 3: Update Archetype System
- [ ] Add new archetype types to `types.ts`
- [ ] Update `cardMatchesArchetype()` in `draftSystem.ts`
- [ ] Create archetype-specific pack generation
- [ ] Test matchups

### Phase 4: Balance Testing
- [ ] Test Aggro vs Control (should favor Aggro)
- [ ] Test Control vs Midrange (should favor Control)
- [ ] Test Midrange vs Aggro (should favor Midrange)
- [ ] Adjust card power levels as needed

## Archetype Type Definitions

### Proposed Type System

```typescript
export type Archetype = 
  // RPS Core Archetypes
  | 'aggro-red'           // Mono Red aggro
  | 'aggro-rw'            // Red/White aggro
  | 'aggro-rb'            // Red/Black aggro
  | 'control-gu'           // Green/Blue control
  | 'control-gub'          // Green/Blue/Black control (Exorcism)
  | 'control-guw'          // Green/Blue/White control
  | 'control-gur'          // Green/Blue/Red control
  | 'midrange-black'       // Black-based midrange
  | 'midrange-bgu'         // Black/Green/Blue midrange
  | 'midrange-brw'         // Black/Red/White midrange
  | 'midrange-4color'      // 4-color midrange
  // Legacy (for compatibility)
  | 'rw-legion'            // Existing RW
  | 'ub-control'           // Existing UB
  | 'ubg-control'          // Existing UBG
  | 'all'                  // All cards
```

### Card Matching Logic

**Aggro Archetypes:**
- Must have red
- Can have 1 additional color (white, black, or green)
- Max 2 colors total
- Heavy on 1-4 mana cards

**Control Archetypes:**
- Must have green and blue
- Can have 1 additional color (black, white, or red)
- Max 3 colors total
- Heavy on 4-7 mana cards

**Midrange Archetypes:**
- Must have black
- Can have 2-3 additional colors
- Max 4 colors total
- Balanced mana curve (2-6 mana)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Matchup Testing
1. **Aggro vs Control**: Should favor Aggro 60-70%
2. **Control vs Midrange**: Should favor Control 60-70%
3. **Midrange vs Aggro**: Should favor Midrange 60-70%

### Balance Goals
- No archetype should win >70% of matchups
- Each archetype should have clear strengths/weaknesses
- Draft decisions should matter (can't just force one archetype)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Clear RPS dynamics
- ✅ Each archetype feels distinct
- ✅ Matchups are skill-testing (not auto-win)
- ✅ Draft decisions are interesting
