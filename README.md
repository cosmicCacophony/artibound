# Artibound

A strategic two-player hero card game built with React + TypeScript, featuring a unique **rune-centric resource system** where each color interacts with runes in distinct ways.

## Core Innovation: The Rune System

Unlike traditional card games with a single resource (mana), Artibound uses a dual-resource system:
- **Mana:** Generic casting cost (grows 1/turn, caps at 10)
- **Runes:** Color requirements generated by heroes

**The key innovation:** Each color has unique mechanics that interact with runes differently:

### Implemented Mechanics (Phase 1)

1. **Blue - Free Spells**
   - Spells refund their mana cost, costing only runes
   - Enables spell-slinging without depleting mana
   - Example: "2U: Draw 2" costs 2 mana + U, refunds 2 mana

2. **Green - Chromatic Payoff**
   - Heroes trigger bonuses when you spend off-color runes
   - Rewards multicolor drafting and diversity
   - Example: "Gains +2 attack when you spend U or B runes"

3. **Black - Blood Magic**
   - Pay tower life instead of missing runes
   - Costs scale by color: Black=4 life, Red/Green=6, Blue/White=8
   - Ultimate flexibility at escalating risk

### Proposed Mechanics (Phase 2 - After Testing)

4. **Red - Rune Amplification** (Proposed)
   - Spend extra runes to amplify spell effects
   - Example: "Deal 3 damage +2 per extra R rune spent"

5. **White - Rune Blessing** (Proposed)
   - Spend extra runes for permanent stat bonuses
   - Example: "Hero gains +1/+1 per extra W rune spent"

## Game Overview

**Setup:**
- 2 battlefields (A and B), each with 20 HP towers
- Turn structure: Play Phase → Combat A → Adjustments → Combat B
- Draft-based hero selection (inspired by Artifact Foundry + Riftbound)

**Victory Conditions:**
- Destroy both enemy towers on one battlefield
- Win condition triggers at end of turn

**Current Status:**
- ~321 draftable cards across 5 colors
- Multiple archetypes (RW Legion, UB Control, BR Aggro, etc.)
- Functional draft system with multicolor support
- Three unique rune mechanics implemented

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Inline styles (component-based)
- **State:** React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Architecture:** Separation of game logic (src/game/) and UI (src/components/)

## Project Goals (Priority Order)

1. **Software Architecture Experience ⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT)**
   - Well-structured, maintainable code
   - Appropriate use of design patterns
   - Scalability and extensibility
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **Game Development Experience ⭐⭐**
   - Solid game design principles
   - Balanced mechanics and progression
   - Engaging player experience

3. **Create a Fun, Playable Game ⭐⭐⭐**
   - Engaging gameplay with meaningful choices
   - Satisfying mechanics
   - Thoughtful balance

4. **Visual Appeal ⭐⭐⭐**
   - Professional UI/UX
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Polished appearance

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Key Documentation

- **[RUNE_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](RUNE_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)** - Comprehensive rune system design and vision
- **[BLOOD_MAGIC_SUMMARY.md](BLOOD_MAGIC_SUMMARY.md)** - Latest implementation (Blood Magic)
- **Project rules in `.cursorrules`** - Development guidelines and context

## Current Development Phase

**Phase 1: Core Rune Mechanics (COMPLETE ✅)**
- Implemented Blue, Green, and Black rune mechanics
- 3 unique color identities established
- Foundation for rune-centric gameplay

**Phase 2: Testing & Iteration (CURRENT)**
- Extensive playtesting needed
- Balance and adjust existing mechanics
- Validate that the rune system is fun
- DO NOT add Red/White mechanics until testing is complete

**Phase 3: Future Expansion (PENDING)**
- Add Red and White rune mechanics (if Phase 2 is successful)
- Expand card pool for existing mechanics
- Polish and refinement

## Design Philosophy

**"Runes are the heart of Artibound."**

Every design decision revolves around the rune system. Colors aren't just deckbuilding constraints—they're strategic resources you actively manipulate during gameplay. This creates depth, meaningful decisions, and rewards creative thinking.
