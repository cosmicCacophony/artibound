## 🎨 Future Vision

*What will this game feel like when it's done?*

[Write a paragraph or two describing your vision - revisit this when you need motivation]

Example:
> "When Artibound is done, I want it to feel like Artifact Foundry - every decision matters, there's always counterplay, and games are tense and exciting. I want to be able to show it to friends and have them immediately understand the strategy. The UI should be clean and the gameplay should be smooth..."
