# Artibound - Playtesting Documentation

This file tracks playtesting sessions, observations, and learnings. Update existing sections rather than creating new files.

## Quick Reference: Turn 1 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Both players have 2 heroes ready to deploy
- [ ] Starting hands have cards (3 cards each)
- [ ] Mana is set to 3/3
- [ ] Both players can deploy during play phase

### Turn 1 Actions to Test
- [ ] Deploy hero to Battlefield A
- [ ] Deploy hero to Battlefield B
- [ ] Position heroes in different slots (1-5)
- [ ] Move heroes between battlefields
- [ ] Play a card from hand (check mana cost enforcement)
- [ ] Position units strategically for combat

### What to Observe
- [ ] Does positioning feel meaningful?
- [ ] Is mana management interesting?
- [ ] Are there clear strategic choices?
- [ ] Does the UI make sense?
- [ ] What's missing for a complete turn 1 experience?

## Turn 1 Testing Sessions

### Session 1 - [Date: ___________]

#### Setup
- **Players**: Player 1 (RW Aggro) vs Player 2 (UB Control)
- **Starting State**: 
  - P1 Heroes: [List heroes]
  - P2 Heroes: [List heroes]
  - P1 Hand: [List cards]
  - P2 Hand: [List cards]
  - Mana: 3/3 for both

#### Actions Taken
1. [What did you do?]
2. [What did you do?]
3. [What did you do?]

#### What Worked Well ✅
- [Specific mechanic/card/decision that felt good]
- [What made it feel good?]
- [Why was it engaging?]

#### What Didn't Work ❌
- [Specific mechanic/card/decision that felt bad]
- [What made it feel bad?]
- [What was missing or confusing?]

#### Balance Observations
**Player 1 (RW Aggro):**
- Too strong: [What felt overpowered?]
- Too weak: [What felt underpowered?]
- Just right: [What felt balanced?]

**Player 2 (UB Control):**
- Too strong: [What felt overpowered?]
- Too weak: [What felt underpowered?]
- Just right: [What felt balanced?]

#### UI/UX Observations
- **Clear**: [What was easy to understand?]
- **Confusing**: [What was unclear or hard to use?]
- **Missing**: [What visual feedback would help?]

#### Missing Features (Blocking Playability)
1. [Critical gap that prevents testing]
2. [Another critical gap]
3. [Nice-to-have but not blocking]

#### Architecture Observations
- **What worked well in the code?** [Easy to test, clear logic, etc.]
- **What was hard to test?** [Unclear state, missing functions, etc.]
- **What would make testing easier?** [Helper functions, better state visibility, etc.]

#### Next Session Goals
- [ ] Test: [Specific thing to test next]
- [ ] Fix: [Critical issue to address]
- [ ] Explore: [New mechanic to try]
