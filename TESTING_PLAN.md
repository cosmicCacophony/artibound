# Artibound - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview

This document provides a structured approach to efficiently playtest Artibound against yourself. The goal is to systematically identify what works, what doesn't, and what needs adjustment in cards, mechanics, and balance.

**Current State:**
- ✅ 2 Archetypes: RW (Red/White) Legion Aggro vs UB (Blue/Black) Control
- ✅ Full turn structure: Play → Combat A → Adjust → Combat B
- ✅ Mana system (3-10), Gold system, Item Shop
- ✅ Combat system with positional targeting
- ✅ Heroes, Signature Cards, Generic Units, Spells

---

## Self-Playtesting Strategy

### Core Principle: "Two Minds, One Game"

When playtesting against yourself, you need to:
1. **Alternate perspectives** - Make decisions as if you don't know the other player's hand
2. **Play to win** - Try to win with both sides, not just test mechanics
3. **Document decisions** - Note why you made choices and how they felt
4. **Test specific scenarios** - Don't just play randomly; test specific interactions

### Efficient Testing Workflow

1. **Quick Games (10-15 min)** - Test early game balance and opening plays
2. **Full Games (30-45 min)** - Test complete game flow and late-game balance
3. **Scenario Tests (5-10 min)** - Test specific card interactions or edge cases
4. **Archetype Matchups** - Systematically test RW vs UB from different angles

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Game Pressure Test
**Goal:** Test if RW can apply early pressure and if UB can stabilize

**Setup:**
- Both players start with 3 mana
- RW gets aggressive early units (3-4 mana)
- UB gets defensive/removal cards

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Can RW deploy threats on turns 1-3?
- [ ] Can UB answer early threats efficiently?
- [ ] Is mana curve smooth for both archetypes?
- [ ] Do early decisions feel meaningful?

**Success Criteria:**
- RW should feel like it can pressure but not auto-win
- UB should feel like it can stabilize but not auto-win
- Both players should have interesting choices

---

### Scenario 2: Mid-Game Resource Management
**Goal:** Test mana efficiency, card advantage, and positioning

**Setup:**
- Both players at 5-7 mana
- Both have units on both battlefields
- Test item shop purchases

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Is mana a meaningful constraint?
- [ ] Do players have interesting choices about which battlefield to commit to?
- [ ] Are item shop purchases impactful?
- [ ] Does positioning matter (slot 1-5)?

**Success Criteria:**
- Players should feel resource constraints
- Positioning should create tactical decisions
- Items should feel impactful but not game-breaking

---

### Scenario 3: Late Game Win Conditions
**Goal:** Test how games end and if both archetypes have viable paths to victory

**Setup:**
- Both players at 8-10 mana
- Test tower destruction scenarios
- Test nexus destruction scenarios

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Can RW close out games with aggression?
- [ ] Can UB control the board and win late?
- [ ] Are tower HP values (20) appropriate?
- [ ] Is nexus HP (30) appropriate?
- [ ] Do games end in a satisfying way?

**Success Criteria:**
- Both archetypes should have viable win conditions
- Games should end decisively, not drag on
- Win conditions should feel earned, not random

---

### Scenario 4: Card Interaction Tests
**Goal:** Test specific card mechanics and interactions

**Test Cases:**

#### RW Legion Synergy
- [ ] Do Legion units work well together?
- [ ] Are Legion buffs impactful?
- [ ] Is the "go-wide" strategy viable?

#### UB Control Tools
- [ ] Do removal spells feel appropriately costed?
- [ ] Can UB generate card advantage?
- [ ] Does control feel like it can stabilize?

#### Signature Cards
- [ ] Are signature cards impactful?
- [ ] Do they feel unique to their heroes?
- [ ] Is having 2 copies per hero the right number?

#### Generic Units
- [ ] Are generic units balanced vs signature cards?
- [ ] Do they provide meaningful choices?

---

### Scenario 5: Battlefield Strategy
**Goal:** Test if the dual battlefield system creates interesting decisions

**Setup:**
- Test scenarios where one player focuses on one battlefield
- Test scenarios where players split resources

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Is it viable to focus on one battlefield?
- [ ] Is it viable to split resources?
- [ ] Do battlefield choices feel meaningful?
- [ ] Does the "Adjust" phase create interesting decisions?

**Success Criteria:**
- Both strategies (focus vs split) should be viable
- Battlefield choices should feel strategic, not arbitrary

- [ ] Test stats (attack/health ratios)
- [ ] Test tower HP (20 feels right?)
- [ ] Test nexus HP (30 feels right?)
- [ ] Test item costs and effects
- [ ] Test signature card power levels

**Success:** Numbers feel right, games are competitive.

---

### Phase 4: Fun Factor (Week 4)

## Efficient Self-Playtesting Tips

### 1. Use "Blind Testing"
- Don't look at both hands at once
- Make decisions for one player, then switch perspective
- Try to "forget" what the other player has

### 2. Test Specific Questions
Instead of "let's play a game," ask:
- "Can RW win if it goes all-in on Battlefield A?"
- "Can UB stabilize if RW gets a perfect start?"
- "What happens if both players ignore one battlefield?"

### 3. Use Save States
- Save game state at key decision points
- Replay scenarios with different choices
- Compare outcomes

### 4. Document As You Go
- Keep notes open while playing
- Write down observations immediately
- Don't rely on memory

### 5. Test Edge Cases
- What if a player draws all high-cost cards?
- What if a player draws all low-cost cards?
- What if both players focus on one battlefield?
- What if a player gets mana-screwed?

### 6. Test Both Sides Aggressively
- Try to win with RW as hard as possible
- Try to win with UB as hard as possible
- See which side wins more often
- Adjust balance accordingly

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Game Length
- **Target:** 15-30 minutes per game
- **Track:** Average game length
- **Adjust if:** Games are too short (not enough decisions) or too long (feels grindy)

### Win Rates
- **Target:** 50/50 in balanced matchup
- **Track:** RW win rate vs UB win rate
- **Adjust if:** One archetype wins >60% of games

### Decision Points
- **Track:** How many meaningful decisions per turn?
- **Target:** 2-4 meaningful decisions per turn
- **Adjust if:** Too many (overwhelming) or too few (boring)

### Resource Utilization
- **Track:** How often do players use all their mana?
- **Target:** Players should use most of their mana most turns
- **Adjust if:** Players frequently have leftover mana (cards too cheap) or can't play anything (cards too expensive)

---

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Balance Issues
- **One archetype always wins:** Need to adjust power levels
- **Games always go to late game:** Early game too weak or late game too strong
- **Games always end early:** Early game too strong or late game too weak

### Fun Issues
- **No meaningful decisions:** Too many auto-plays
- **Too many decisions:** Analysis paralysis
- **Feels random:** Not enough player agency
- **Feels scripted:** Too predictable

### Mechanic Issues
- **Mana feels irrelevant:** Cards too cheap or too expensive
- **Positioning doesn't matter:** Combat system needs work
- **Battlefields feel same:** Need more differentiation
- **Items feel weak:** Need to increase impact or lower cost

---

## Testing Schedule Recommendation

### Daily Testing (15-30 min)
- Quick game or scenario test
- Focus on one specific question
- Document findings

### Weekly Deep Dive (1-2 hours)
- Full playtest session
- Complete checklist
- Balance assessment
- Plan adjustments

### Monthly Review
- Review all testing notes
- Identify patterns
- Make major balance adjustments
- Test new changes

## Quick Reference: Testing Questions

Before each playtest, ask yourself:

1. **What am I testing today?**
   - Specific card? Specific mechanic? Overall balance?

2. **What would success look like?**
   - What outcome would indicate this works well?

3. **What would failure look like?**
   - What outcome would indicate this needs work?

4. **What am I comparing against?**
   - Previous version? Similar games? Design goals?

After each playtest, ask yourself:

1. **What surprised me?**
   - What happened that I didn't expect?

2. **What felt good?**
   - What moments were fun or satisfying?

3. **What felt bad?**
   - What moments were frustrating or boring?

4. **What would I change?**
   - Specific adjustments to make

5. **What should I test next?**
   - Follow-up questions or scenarios

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Scenario 1** (Early Game Pressure Test)
2. **Use the checklist template** for your first session
3. **Document findings** in `PLAYTESTING.md`
