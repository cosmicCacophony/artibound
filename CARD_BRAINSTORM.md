# Card Brainstorming - RW & UBG Decks

## Design Principles

Based on our multicolor design discussion:
- **Bouncing is already valuable** - Protection, gold denial, and flexibility are benefit enough
- **Bounce synergies should be niche** - Not ubiquitous bonuses
- **Create interesting decisions** - Cards should add strategic depth around when to bounce vs. stay on board
- **RW = Aggro** - Punishes bouncing, wants to stay on board and pressure
- **UBG = Control** - Uses bouncing strategically, but still needs to balance tempo

## RW (Red/White) - Aggro Deck Cards

### 1. **Relentless Assault** (Red/White)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 3 mana (RW)
- **Effect:** "If you have more heroes on the battlefield than your opponent, all your units gain +2 attack this turn."
- **Design Intent:** Punishes opponents who bounce too much. Rewards aggressive board presence. Creates tension - opponent bouncing gives you a damage boost, but you need to maintain board presence to use it.

### 2. **Tower Focus** (Red)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 2 mana (R)
- **Effect:** "Target unit can attack towers directly this turn. If opponent has 2 or fewer heroes on the battlefield, it gains +3 attack."
- **Design Intent:** Rewards going all-in on towers when opponent bounces. Low cost makes it easy to cast, but requires board presence. Creates a threat that opponents need to respect.

### 3. **Frontline Warrior** (Red/White)
- **Type:** Generic Unit
- **Cost:** 4 mana (RW)
- **Stats:** 4/4
- **Effect:** "When this enters, if you have more heroes on the battlefield than your opponent, it gains +2/+2."
- **Design Intent:** Rewards maintaining board presence. Strong when ahead on board, weaker when behind. Encourages aggressive play and punishes excessive bouncing.

### 4. **War Banner** (Red/White)
- **Type:** Generic Unit
- **Cost:** 3 mana (RW)
- **Stats:** 2/3
- **Effect:** "All your units gain +1 attack. If you have 3+ heroes on the battlefield, they gain +2 attack instead."
- **Design Intent:** Aura effect that rewards board presence. Stronger when you have more heroes, encouraging you to stay on board rather than bounce. Creates a scaling threat.

### 5. **Rally Charge** (Red/White)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 4 mana (RW)
- **Effect:** "All your units gain +2 attack this turn and can attack immediately. Draw a card if you have 3+ heroes on the battlefield."
- **Design Intent:** Aggressive pump spell that rewards board presence. The card draw is a bonus for maintaining heroes on board, not a general bonus. Creates a big turn when you're ahead.

## UBG (Blue/Black/Green) - Control Deck Cards

### 1. **Tactical Repositioning** (Blue/Green)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 2 mana (UG)
- **Effect:** "Return target hero to base. It can be deployed this turn without paying mana cost."
- **Design Intent:** Makes bouncing cheaper and more flexible. Situational - only worth it when you need to reposition. Doesn't make bouncing always correct, just makes it more viable when strategically needed.

### 2. **Convergence Spell** (Blue/Black/Green)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 7 mana (UBG - requires all 3 colors)
- **Effect:** "Deal 5 damage to all enemy units. Draw cards equal to the number of different colors among your heroes."
- **Design Intent:** High-impact spell that rewards having multicolor heroes in the right lanes. Worth bouncing to enable, but bouncing still costs tempo. The spell needs to be powerful enough to justify the setup.

### 3. **Verdant Shield** (Green/Blue)
- **Type:** Generic Unit
- **Cost:** 3 mana (UG)
- **Stats:** 2/4
- **Effect:** "When this enters, if you bounced a hero this turn, gain +1 max mana."
- **Design Intent:** Niche synergy - only triggers if you bounced this turn. Doesn't make bouncing always correct, but gives a small reward for strategic bouncing. The unit itself is defensive, fitting control.

### 4. **Prismatic Guardian** (Blue/Black/Green)
- **Type:** Generic Unit
- **Cost:** 5 mana (UBG)
- **Stats:** 3/6
- **Effect:** "This has +0/+1 for each different color among your heroes."
- **Design Intent:** Rewards having multicolor heroes in play. Stronger when you have more colors, encouraging you to maintain board presence. But still vulnerable, so bouncing to protect it is a valid strategy. Creates interesting decisions.

### 5. **Nature's Revenge** (Green/Black)
- **Type:** Spell
- **Cost:** 4 mana (GB)
- **Effect:** "Destroy target unit with 4 or less health. If you control heroes of 3+ different colors, draw a card."
- **Design Intent:** Removal spell that rewards multicolor board presence. The card draw is conditional on having diverse colors, not on bouncing. Encourages maintaining board presence while still being useful removal.

## Design Notes

### RW Cards Focus On:
- **Punishing bouncing** - Rewards for having more heroes on board
- **Tower pressure** - Tools to go all-in when opponent bounces
- **Board presence** - Cards that scale with number of heroes
- **Aggressive tempo** - Low-cost, high-impact plays

### UBG Cards Focus On:
- **Strategic bouncing** - Tools that make bouncing more viable when needed
- **Multicolor rewards** - Cards that benefit from having diverse colors
- **High-impact spells** - Spells worth bouncing to enable
- **Control tools** - Removal and defensive options

### Common Themes:
- **No ubiquitous bounce bonuses** - Bouncing is already valuable
- **Board presence matters** - Both decks care about maintaining heroes
- **Interesting decisions** - Cards create tension, not obvious plays
- **Strategic depth** - Rewards good play and reading the board

## Questions for Playtesting

1. **RW Questions:**
   - Do the "more heroes" effects create enough pressure?
   - Is Tower Focus too strong/weak?
   - Do the units feel impactful enough?

2. **UBG Questions:**
   - Is Tactical Repositioning worth a card slot?
   - Is Convergence Spell powerful enough to justify bouncing?
   - Do the multicolor rewards feel meaningful?

3. **General Questions:**
   - Does the tension between bouncing and board presence feel good?
   - Are there any cards that make bouncing always correct?
   - Do the cards create interesting decisions?
