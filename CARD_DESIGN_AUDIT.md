# Card Design Audit - Session Document

## Overview

This document audits RW and UBG cards against our design philosophy. Each card is evaluated against key design principles to identify what's working and what might need adjustment.

**Design Principles Checklist:**
- ✅ Follows power level → color system (1-3 mana = single, 4-5 = dual, 6-8 = triple)
- ✅ Creates interesting game states / mastery moments
- ✅ Supports archetype identity (RW = aggro, UBG = control)
- ✅ Creates meaningful decisions (combat tricks, positioning, timing)
- ✅ Has counterplay options
- ✅ Rewards skill over luck
- ✅ Appropriate for mana cost

**Note:** Some vanilla cards are needed - not every card can be equally strong in a healthy card game.

### RW Design Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Good combat tricks (Fighting Words, Into the Fray)
- ✅ Legion tribal synergy creates decisions
- ✅ Positioning spells (Whirling Death, Unbreakable Column)
- ✅ Team buffs support go-wide strategy
- ✅ Signature cards feel impactful

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Some 2-mana cards are dual color (Bronze Legionnaire, Path of Valor, Unbreakable Column)
  - **Question**: Should these be single color for easier early casting?
  - **Consideration**: They're not too powerful, but dual color at 2 mana might be restrictive
- ❌ Soldier is vanilla - acceptable as filler, but could be more interesting
- ⚠️ Missing some combat tricks for "bluff game" (need more 1-2 mana tricks)
- ⚠️ Missing tower pressure cards (Tower Focus, Execute, etc. from mastery moments)
- ⚠️ Missing timing cards (AOE protection, commit cards)

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider making Bronze Legionnaire single color (R or W) if 2 mana dual is too restrictive
2. Add more combat tricks (1-2 mana) for bluff game
3. Add tower pressure cards (Tower Focus, Execute)
4. Add timing cards (Disperse, All-In)
5. Soldier is fine as vanilla filler

### UBG Design Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Exorcism is perfect - creates positioning mastery moments
- ✅ Multicolor heroes support 3-4 color system
- ✅ Ramp units enable big spells
- ✅ Defensive units fit control archetype

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Verdant Colossus is 8 mana dual color (UG) - should this be triple color (UBG)?
  - **Question**: Is 8 mana too powerful for dual color?
  - **Consideration**: 6/8 is strong but not game-breaking, dual might be okay
- ⚠️ Spawnling is 2 mana dual color (GB) - vanilla token
  - **Question**: Should 2 mana dual be single color?
  - **Consideration**: Token is fine, but dual color at 2 mana might be restrictive
- ⚠️ Arcane Sweep is 6 mana single color (U) - very powerful AOE
  - **Question**: Should 6 mana powerful effect be dual/triple color?
  - **Consideration**: 4 damage to all is very strong, might need color requirement
- ⚠️ Arcane Bolt is 4 mana single color (U) - good removal
  - **Question**: Should 4 mana removal be dual color?
  - **Consideration**: 4 damage is strong, but single color keeps it accessible
- ⚠️ Arcane Removal is 2 mana dual color (UB) - conditional removal
  - **Question**: Should 2 mana dual be single color?
  - **Consideration**: Conditional (3 or less health) might justify dual color
- ❌ Missing removal spells (from ARTIFACT_CARD_ANALYSIS.md)
  - Need: 3 mana deal 3 + initiative (B)
  - Need: 4 mana kill hero + discard (UB)
  - Need: 2 mana invulnerable + reflect (B) - **KEY for combat setup!**
- ❌ Missing AOE spells
  - Need: 3 mana deal 2 to all (U)
  - Need: 4 mana deal 6 distributed (UB) - for spell timing decisions
- ❌ Missing positioning spells
  - Need: 1 mana move hero (B)
- ❌ Missing combat setup spells
  - Need: 2 mana invulnerable + reflect (B) - **KEY for early game decisions!**
  - Need: 2 mana stun (B or U) - Light Strike Array is close but positioning-specific

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider making Verdant Colossus triple color (UBG) if 8 mana dual is too powerful
2. Add removal spells from ARTIFACT_CARD_ANALYSIS.md
3. Add AOE spells for spell timing decisions
4. Add positioning and combat setup spells
5. Spawnling is fine as vanilla token, but consider single color if 2 mana dual is too restrictive

## Design Principles Reference

### Power Level → Color System
- **1-3 mana**: Single color (easier to cast early, less powerful)
- **4-5 mana**: Dual color (requires some setup, medium power)
- **6-8 mana**: Triple color (requires positioning/bouncing, high power)

### Game States / Mastery Moments
- **Initiative & Mana Management**: Passing vs casting
- **Exorcism Positioning**: Adjacency, bounce decisions
- **Combat Tricks**: Bluff game, "do I have the answer?"
- **Tower vs Units**: Gold vs pressure decisions
- **Spell Timing**: Efficiency vs maximum value
- **Homunculus**: Early safety vs late value

### Archetype Identity
- **RW**: Aggro, go-wide, combat tricks, positioning, tower pressure
- **UBG**: Control, removal, AOE, card advantage, late game

### Meaningful Decisions
- Combat tricks (when to use, when to bluff)
- Positioning (adjacency, slots)
- Timing (commit vs hold, efficiency vs maximum value)
- Resource management (mana, gold, cards)

### Counterplay
- Every strategy should have answers
- Cards should be answerable
- No "draw the nuts and win" scenarios

### Skill Expression
- Better players make better decisions
- Small advantages compound
- Close games feel skill-intensive
- Luck matters less than skill
