# Card Design Audit - Session Document

## Overview

This document audits RW and UBG cards against our design philosophy. Each card is evaluated against key design principles to identify what's working and what might need adjustment.

**Design Principles Checklist:**
- ✅ Follows power level → color system (1-3 mana = single, 4-5 = dual, 6-8 = triple)
- ✅ Creates interesting game states / mastery moments
- ✅ Supports archetype identity (RW = aggro, UBG = control)
- ✅ Creates meaningful decisions (combat tricks, positioning, timing)
- ✅ Has counterplay options
- ✅ Rewards skill over luck
- ✅ Appropriate for mana cost

**Note:** Some vanilla cards are needed - not every card can be equally strong in a healthy card game.

## Design Principles Reference

### Power Level → Color System
- **1-3 mana**: Single color (easier to cast early, less powerful)
- **4-5 mana**: Dual color (requires some setup, medium power)
- **6-8 mana**: Triple color (requires positioning/bouncing, high power)

### Game States / Mastery Moments
- **Initiative & Mana Management**: Passing vs casting
- **Exorcism Positioning**: Adjacency, bounce decisions
- **Combat Tricks**: Bluff game, "do I have the answer?"
- **Tower vs Units**: Gold vs pressure decisions
- **Spell Timing**: Efficiency vs maximum value
- **Homunculus**: Early safety vs late value

### Archetype Identity
- **RW**: Aggro, go-wide, combat tricks, positioning, tower pressure
- **UBG**: Control, removal, AOE, card advantage, late game

### Meaningful Decisions
- Combat tricks (when to use, when to bluff)
- Positioning (adjacency, slots)
- Timing (commit vs hold, efficiency vs maximum value)
- Resource management (mana, gold, cards)

### Counterplay
- Every strategy should have answers
- Cards should be answerable
- No "draw the nuts and win" scenarios

### Skill Expression
- Better players make better decisions
- Small advantages compound
- Close games feel skill-intensive
- Luck matters less than skill
