---

### Strategy

**Game Plan:**
1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3)**: Deploy RW heroes, play Legion units, establish board presence
2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**: Deploy RG hero (Wild Brawler) or G hero (Nature Warrior), play RG splash cards for beefy threats
3. **Late Game (Turns 7+)**: Cast RWG convergence spells for powerful team buffs, finish with big RG threats

**Key Synergies:**
- **Legion Tribal**: Bronze Legionnaire, Imperial Herald, Legion Standard Bearer, Wild Legionnaire all benefit from Legion synergies
- **Team Buffs**: Rally Banner, Rally the Legion, Convergence Rally, Growth Rally all buff the team
- **Growth Theme**: Wild Legionnaire and Growth Rally add permanent +1/+1 counters (Green's growth theme)
- **Beefy Threats**: Wild Beast and Raging Bear provide big bodies that RW lacks

**Mana Curve:**
- 2 mana: 2 cards (Bronze Legionnaire × 2)
- 3 mana: 6 cards (Imperial Herald, Legion Standard Bearer, Wild Legionnaire, Into the Fray, War Cry × 2)
- 4 mana: 4 cards (Wild Beast × 2, Growth Rally, Rally the Legion)
- 5 mana: 1 card (Raging Bear)
- 6 mana: 1 card (Convergence Rally)

**Color Requirements:**
- **RW cards (6)**: Need Valiant Commander (RW) + any R or W hero → Easy with War Captain (R) or Nature Warrior (G) in other battlefield
- **RG cards (4)**: Need Wild Brawler (RG) + any R or G hero → Easy with War Captain (R) or Nature Warrior (G)
- **RWG cards (2)**: Need Wild Brawler (RG) + Valiant Commander (RW) + Nature Warrior (G) → Requires all 3 colors, harder to cast but very powerful

**Draft Considerations:**
- Prioritize RG hero (Wild Brawler) early to enable RG splash
- Pick G hero (Nature Warrior) to enable RWG convergence cards
- Draft RG cards that are powerful enough to justify the splash (Wild Beast, Raging Bear)
- Only draft 1-2 RWG cards (they're powerful but hard to cast)

## UB Splash Green (UBG) - "Verdant Control"

### Hero Lineup
**1 Multicolor Hero:**

2. **Void Bolt** (UB, 3 mana spell) × 2 (from Dark Archmage)
3. **Death Ritual** (B, 4 mana spell) × 2 (from Void Necromancer)

#### Drafted Cards (12 cards)

---

### Strategy

**Game Plan:**
1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3)**: Deploy UB heroes, play removal spells, control the board
2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6)**: Deploy UG hero (Mana Druid) or G hero (Nature Warrior), play mana ramp, accelerate to late game
3. **Late Game (Turns 7+)**: Cast UBG convergence spells for card advantage, play big finishers (Colossus, Tower Destroyer)

**Key Synergies:**
- **Mana Ramp**: Mana Bloom × 4, Mana Crystal, Leyline all ramp mana, enabling big spells and finishers
- **Card Advantage**: Arcane Mastery, Verdant Control, Prismatic Mastery all draw cards
- **Removal Suite**: Thunderstorm, Shadow Growth, Verdant Bolt provide flexible removal
- **Big Finishers**: Colossus (9/9) and Tower Destroyer (5/7) close out games

**Mana Curve:**
- 3 mana: 5 cards (Void Bolt × 2, Arcane Scholar, Mana Bloom × 2)
- 4 mana: 5 cards (Thunderstorm, Shadow Growth × 2, Leyline, Death Ritual × 2)
- 5 mana: 1 card (Arcane Mastery)
- 6 mana: 1 card (Verdant Control)
- 7 mana: 2 cards (Prismatic Mastery, Tower Destroyer)
- 9 mana: 1 card (Colossus)

**Color Requirements:**
- **UB cards (4)**: Need Dark Archmage (UB) + any U or B hero → Easy with Void Necromancer (B) or Mana Druid (UG)
- **UG cards (1)**: Need Mana Druid (UG) + any U or G hero → Easy with Dark Archmage (UB) or Nature Warrior (G)
- **BG cards (2)**: Need Void Necromancer (B) + Mana Druid (UG) or Nature Warrior (G) → Requires B + G
- **UBG cards (3)**: Need Dark Archmage (UB) + Mana Druid (UG) + Nature Warrior (G) → Requires all 3 colors, harder to cast but very powerful
- **G cards (2)**: Need Mana Druid (UG) or Nature Warrior (G) → Easy

**Draft Considerations:**
- Prioritize UG hero (Mana Druid) early to enable UG splash and mana ramp
- Pick G hero (Nature Warrior) to enable UBG convergence cards and additional mana ramp
- Draft mana ramp cards (Mana Crystal, Leyline) to enable big spells
- Draft BG cards (Shadow Growth) for flexible removal with card advantage
- Only draft 2-3 UBG cards (they're powerful but hard to cast)

## Comparison: RW Splash vs UB Splash

### RW Splash Green (RWG)
**Splash Style**: Light splash
- **RG cards**: 4 cards (Wild Beast × 2, Raging Bear, Wild Legionnaire)
- **RWG cards**: 2 cards (Convergence Rally, Growth Rally)
- **Total splash**: 6 cards (50% of drafted cards)

**Why It Works:**
- RG cards provide beefy threats that RW lacks
- RWG convergence cards are powerful team buffs that fit RW's go-wide strategy
- Green's growth theme (permanent +1/+1 counters) synergizes with RW's team buffs
- Wild Legionnaire bridges Legion tribal with Green's growth

**Hero Distribution**: RG, R, RW, G (1 multicolor, 3 mono/dual)

---

### UB Splash Green (UBG)
**Splash Style**: Heavy splash
- **UG cards**: 1 card (Leyline)
- **BG cards**: 2 cards (Shadow Growth × 2)
- **G cards**: 2 cards (Mana Crystal, Colossus)
- **UBG cards**: 3 cards (Verdant Control, Prismatic Mastery, Verdant Bolt)
- **Total splash**: 8 cards (67% of drafted cards)

**Why It Works:**
- Green provides mana ramp (Mana Bloom × 4, Mana Crystal, Leyline) enabling big spells
- BG cards provide removal with card advantage (Shadow Growth)
- UBG convergence cards provide powerful card advantage and removal
- Green's big finishers (Colossus) complement UB's control strategy

**Hero Distribution**: UG, UB, B, G (1 multicolor, 3 mono/dual)

## Design Notes

### Multicolor Hero Rarity
- Multicolor heroes (RG, UG) are rarer in draft
- Players typically find only 1 multicolor hero per deck
- This creates interesting draft tension: do you commit to the splash or stay 2-color?

### Splash Philosophy
- **RW Splash**: Light splash (6 cards, 50%) - RG provides beefy threats, RWG provides powerful team buffs
- **UB Splash**: Heavy splash (8 cards, 67%) - Green provides ramp and big finishers, UBG provides card advantage

### Color Requirements
- **2-color cards**: Easy to cast with 2-color heroes or 1 multicolor + 1 mono
- **3-color cards**: Harder to cast, require all 3 colors, but very powerful
- **Strategy**: Draft 1-3 three-color cards as powerful late-game plays

### Mana Curve
- Both decks have reasonable curves
- RW Splash: Lower curve (2-6 mana), aggressive
- UB Splash: Higher curve (3-9 mana), control-oriented

### Synergy Themes
- **RW Splash**: Legion tribal + team buffs + growth counters
- **UB Splash**: Mana ramp + card advantage + removal + big finishers

---

## Future Considerations

### 4-Color Decks
Once 4-color decks are implemented:
- **RWG + 4th color**: Could splash Blue for card draw or Black for removal
- **UBG + 4th color**: Could splash Red for aggressive threats or White for resilience

### Draft Balance
- Multicolor heroes should appear less frequently in packs
- 3-color cards should appear in later packs (picks 15-21)
- Draft should reward players who commit to 3-color strategies

### Power Level
- 3-color cards should be 20-30% stronger than 2-color equivalents
- Convergence effects should scale with total color count
- Balance around the difficulty of casting 3-color cards
