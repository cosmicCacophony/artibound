# Artibound: Rune System Design Vision

## Core Philosophy

**Runes are the heart of Artibound.** Unlike traditional card games where mana is the primary resource, Artibound uses a dual-resource system where:
- **Mana** = Generic casting cost (grows 1 per turn, caps at 10)
- **Runes** = Color requirements for spells/abilities (generated by heroes)

**The key innovation:** Each color has unique mechanics that interact with runes in different ways, creating deep strategic gameplay around rune generation, consumption, and manipulation.

---

## The Rune System Foundation

### How Runes Work

1. **Generation:**
   - Deploy a hero → Generate permanent runes of that hero's colors
   - Single-color hero = 1 rune (e.g., Red hero = R)
   - Dual-color hero = 2 runes (e.g., Red/White hero = R + W)
   - Temporary runes from spells/abilities (cleared end of turn)

2. **Consumption:**
   - Spells with `consumesRunes: true` require specific color runes
   - Example: "3UB" = 3 mana + Blue rune + Black rune
   - Runes are consumed when spell is cast
   - Temporary runes consumed before permanent runes

3. **Strategic Tension:**
   - More colors = More flexibility but harder to cast spells
   - Mono-color = Consistent but limited options
   - Rune mechanics reward finding creative ways to use this tension

## Implemented Color Mechanics (v1.0)

### 1. Blue - Free Spells (Tempo/Efficiency)

**Mechanic:** Spells cost X mana + runes, but refund the X mana upon casting.

**Examples:**
- "2U: Swap two heroes" - Costs 2 mana + U rune, refunds 2 mana → Net cost: U rune only
- "3UU: Draw 2 cards and heal 3" - Costs 3 mana + UU, refunds 3 mana → Net cost: UU only

**Strategic Identity:**
- **Tempo advantage:** Cast multiple spells per turn without depleting mana
- **Rune gating:** Still requires rune generation (draft blue heroes)
- **Spell-slinger archetype:** Enables control/combo strategies
- **Multicolor reward:** Access to more runes = more free spells

**Inspired by:** Magic's Urza block (Treachery, Frantic Search, Snap)

---

### 2. Green - Chromatic Payoff (Diversity/Synergy)

**Mechanic:** Heroes trigger bonus effects when you spend runes of colors they don't produce.

**Examples:**
- "Chromatic Brawler (RG): Gains +2 attack when you spend U or B runes"
- "Chromatic Destroyer (GB): Deals 1 damage per U or W rune spent"
- "Chromatic Sage (GU): Gains 1 mana when you spend R or W runes"

**Payoff Types:**
- Damage, Healing, +Attack, Card Draw, Mana, Runes
- Can trigger once per spell OR per rune spent

**Strategic Identity:**
- **Rewards diversity:** Incentivizes drafting multicolor
- **Rewards spell-casting:** Doesn't conflict with consuming runes
- **Scales naturally:** More colors = more triggers
- **Green's flexibility identity:** Growth, adaptability, color fixing

---

### 3. Black - Blood Magic (Flexibility/Risk)

**Mechanic:** Pay tower life instead of missing runes when casting spells.

**Cost Structure (per tower × 2 for total):**
- **Black runes:** 2 life/tower (4 total)
- **Red/Green runes:** 3 life/tower (6 total)
- **Blue/White runes:** 4 life/tower (8 total)

**Examples:**
- "Blood Mage (RB): Pay tower life for any missing runes (unlimited)"
- "Blood Magic Adept (RB): Pay reduced life (-1 per rune) for missing runes"
- "Desperate Necromancer (UB): Pay life for up to 2 missing runes per spell"
- "Dark Ritualist (Mono-B): Pay 1 life/tower for BLACK runes only"

**Strategic Identity:**
- **Ultimate flexibility:** Can cast any spell regardless of runes
- **Escalating costs:** Enemy colors cost more (thematic + balanced)
- **Risk/reward:** Life as a resource vs. tower survival
- **Enables greed:** Splash any color at a price
- **Black's ruthless identity:** Power at any cost

---

## Future Color Mechanics (Design Space)

**IMPORTANT:** Test Blue, Green, and Black thoroughly before implementing these. Ensure the rune system is fun and balanced first.

### 4. Red - Rune Amplification (PROPOSED)

**Mechanic:** Spend extra runes beyond the spell's cost to amplify effects.

**Example Concepts:**
```
"Fireball" - 3R
Deal 3 damage to target unit.
For each extra R rune spent, deal +2 damage.

"Berserker Rage" - 2RR
Target hero gains +3 attack this turn.
Spend RR: Gains +6 attack and First Strike instead.

"Chain Lightning" - 4R
Deal X damage where X = number of runes spent casting this spell.
```

**Strategic Identity:**
- **All-in aggression:** Convert excess runes into raw power
- **Variable power:** Same spell, different outcomes based on runes
- **Risk/reward:** Spend more runes for bigger payoff
- **Red's impulsive identity:** More is more, go big or go home

**Design Considerations:**
- Needs mana + rune economy balance (can't be too cheap or too expensive)
- Should feel explosive and impactful
- Could work well with temporary rune generation
- Synergizes with green's chromatic payoff (spending runes triggers bonuses)

---

### 5. White - Rune Blessing (PROPOSED)

**Mechanic:** Spend extra runes for scaling, permanent stat bonuses.

**Example Concepts:**
```
"Divine Blessing" - 2W
Target hero gains +1/+1 permanently.
For each extra W rune spent, gains an additional +1/+1 (max 3).

"Consecration" - 3WW
Deploy: You may spend up to 3 extra runes.
This hero gains +1/+1 per rune spent.

"Shield of Faith" - WW
Target hero gains +0/+3 and cannot be destroyed this turn.
Spend WW: Effect is permanent instead.
```

**Strategic Identity:**
- **Scaling permanence:** Convert runes into lasting advantages
- **Protective growth:** Build up heroes over time
- **Resource conversion:** Turn excess runes into stats
- **White's protective identity:** Defend, protect, outlast

**Design Considerations:**
- Bonuses should be permanent to justify rune investment
- Needs clear max limits to prevent runaway scaling
- Should feel like building a fortress brick by brick
- Synergizes with green's chromatic payoff
- Could enable "rune bank" strategies (save runes for big blessing turns)

## Why This System Works

### 1. Clear Color Identities
Each color has a unique relationship with runes:
- **Blue:** Efficiency - Use runes for tempo, not mana
- **Green:** Diversity - Rewarded for spending any runes
- **Black:** Flexibility - Bypass runes entirely (at a cost)
- **Red (proposed):** Power - Convert runes into raw damage/stats
- **White (proposed):** Growth - Convert runes into permanent advantages

### 2. Strategic Depth
- **Draft decisions:** Which colors provide the most value?
- **Deck building:** How many colors can I support?
- **In-game decisions:** When to spend runes? Which mechanic to leverage?
- **Resource management:** Mana vs. Runes vs. Life vs. Card advantage

### 3. Interesting Tensions
- **Mono-color:** Consistent runes, but miss out on multicolor payoffs
- **Two-color:** Balanced flexibility and consistency
- **Three+ colors:** Maximum payoffs, but harder to cast spells
- **Rune generation:** Need heroes for runes, but heroes compete for battlefield slots

### 4. Rewards Skill
- **Drafting:** Reading signals, building around mechanics
- **Sequencing:** Which heroes to deploy first for optimal rune access
- **Timing:** When to use Blood Magic vs. generating more runes
- **Risk assessment:** Is this spell worth 12 tower life?

## Design Principles

### For All Rune Mechanics:

1. **Must be unique per color** - No overlap in identity
2. **Must interact with runes meaningfully** - Not just "have runes"
3. **Must create interesting decisions** - Not autopilot
4. **Must scale with investment** - Reward building around the mechanic
5. **Must have clear counterplay** - Not oppressive

### Implementation Order:

**Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** Blue, Green, Black
- Establish foundation
- Test core rune interactions
- Validate the system is fun

**Phase 2 (TESTING):** Play extensively, iterate, balance
- Ensure mechanics feel good
- Adjust costs if needed
- Add heroes/cards as needed

**Phase 3 (FUTURE):** Red, White (if Phase 2 is successful)
- Only add if rune system proves fun
- Keep same design principles
- Maintain clear color identities

---

## Current Card Count

- **Total Draftable Cards:** ~321
- **Blue Free Spell Cards:** 10 spells
- **Green Chromatic Heroes:** 4 heroes (RG, GW, GB, GU)
- **Black Blood Magic Heroes:** 5 heroes (RB×2, UB, GB, Mono-B)

---

## Testing Priorities

### Must Validate:

1. **Is the rune system fun?**
   - Does it create interesting decisions?
   - Is it too complex or just right?
   - Do players enjoy the resource management?

2. **Are the three mechanics balanced?**
   - Is one mechanic clearly better?
   - Do they create diverse strategies?
   - Can they coexist in the same draft?

3. **Does multicolor feel good?**
   - Is splashing viable?
   - Is mono-color viable?
   - Is there a sweet spot (2-3 colors)?

4. **Is Blood Magic fun or frustrating?**
   - Do the confirmation dialogs feel good?
   - Are the life costs appropriate?
   - Does it enable cool strategies?

### If Testing Goes Well:

- Add more cards for existing mechanics
- Fine-tune costs and effects
- Consider Red/White mechanics

### If Testing Reveals Issues:

- Adjust costs (life, mana, runes)
- Add more rune generation sources
- Simplify mechanics if too complex
- Consider removing a mechanic if unfun

## Vision Statement

**Artibound is a rune-centric card game where each color has a unique way to interact with the rune system.** 

Mana grows predictably, but runes create strategic tension: How many colors do you draft? Which mechanics do you build around? When do you spend your runes? This creates deep gameplay that rewards skill and creativity.

Unlike traditional CCGs where color is just a deckbuilding constraint, **in Artibound, color is a strategic resource you actively manipulate during the game.**
